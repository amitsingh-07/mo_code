                Insurance policies bought through MoneyOwl may be eligible for commission rebates, except the following: 
                <ul>
                  <li>Private Integrated Shield Plans</li>
                  <li>Local hospitalisation plans</li>
                  <li>Eldershield supplements</li>
                  <li>Plans purchased using CPF monies</li>
                  </ul>
                  All commission rebates are subject to the relevant insurer’s terms and conditions.<br/>
                </li>
              <li>
                  Where we offer a rebate of basic commission (also known as “agent’s commission”) for any product:
                  <ol type="a">
                    <li>We rebate up to 50% of basic commission after deducting an administrative charge (currently less than S$30).</li>
                    <li>If premiums are paid yearly, we will make payment of the rebate due to you as soon as practicable after we receive it from the relevant insurer(s).  As a general guide, we receive our commission from the insurer 2-3 months after the date of inception/anniversary date of the insurance policy. The payout term is usually 3- 6 years long.</li>
                    <li>If your premiums are paid monthly, we will make payment of the rebate due to you once a year, generally at the end of the calendar year.</li>
                    <li>If an insurer does not provide a breakdown showing the amount of basic commissions comprised in the total commissions received by us from the insurer at the time that such commissions are received by us, then the amount of basic commissions shall be deemed to be 45% of the total commissions received by us, for the purpose of computing the amount of rebate to be paid to you (if any).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
              <li>
                  All rebates will be credited directly into your designated bank account less any applicable taxes (including without limitation, goods and services tax) at the prevailing rate, and administrative and bank charges.  It is your obligation to inform us if you wish to use another bank account to receive rebates, and to inform us of changes to your contact details.  Although we will endeavour to notify you if the rebates cannot be to be paid into your designated account for whatever reason, we are under no obligation to do so.
                </li>
              <li>
                  The various insurers have a right to clawback commissions paid on any insurance policy if the policy is cancelled within the contractual period stipulated by the insurer. MoneyOwl reserves the right to require you to repay up to the full amount of the commissions paid out by the insurer in the event where you cancel any particular insurance policy during such contractual period and the insurer proceeds to exercise its rights to clawback any commissions paid out on the policy.
                </li>
              <li>
                  Medical expenses may be incurred in connection with medical examinations which may be required in connection with insurance policy applications. You will need to bear the medical expenses if (a) you cancel or fail to take up a policy after the proposal has been accepted by the insurer, or (b) the proposal lapses or is deemed withdrawn by the insurer because you failed to submit all necessary documents required by the insurer. If you cancel any insurance policy within the cancellation period set out in the policy document, any insurance premium paid by you will be refunded only after deduction of the applicable medical expenses and administrative fees.
