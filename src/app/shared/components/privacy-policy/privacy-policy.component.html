              <li>These Terms and Conditions are an integral part of the agreement between you and us in relation to any work we perform for you.  In these terms and conditions, unless the context requires otherwise, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo; refers to Moneyowl Private Limited. &ldquo;You&rdquo; and &ldquo;your&rdquo; refers to any individual and/or organisation who contract with us.</li>
              <li>We may amend these terms from time to time by written notice to you (including notice by way of email).  The new terms will take effect 30 days after we have sent the notice to you at your last known address/email address.  If you do not agree to the amended terms and conditions, it is your obligation to notify us, and you accept that we may have to terminate our relationship with you.  Your continued receipt of rebates paid by us will be deemed to be an acceptance of the amended terms and conditions.</li>
              <li>You have to inform us if you do not accept our Privacy Policy.  If you do not accept our Privacy Policy, you should not provide us with any personal data, as we may not be able to offer any services to you or establish any kind of relationship with you</li>

              <li class="default-ol">
                You may be entitled to rebates from the commission we receive, as indicated below:
                <ol>
                  <li>rebate of 50% of all basic commission we receive, for any insurance policies (excluding hospital and surgical and medical insurance policies) that you purchase;</li>
                  <li>rebate of 30% of all basic commission we receive, from any worldwide hospital and surgical and medical insurance policies that you purchase.</li> 
                  </ol> 
              </li>
              <li>No rebate will be provided for other types of insurance, including long term care policies and integrated shield plans (local hospital and surgical and medical insurance policies), as well as any insurance policies that are paid for, in whole or part, using CPF.</li>
              <li>If required under the law, we may charge goods and services tax on fees payable by you, or pay withholding tax to the authorities on rebates payable to you.</li>
              <li class="default-ol">
                Where we offer a rebate of basic commission for any product:
                <ol>
                  <li>If premiums are paid yearly, we will make payment of the rebate due to you as soon as practicable after we receive it from the relevant insurer(s).  As a general guide, we receive our commission from the insurer 2-3 months after the date of inception/anniversary date of the insurance policy.</li>
                  <li>If your premiums are paid monthly, we will make payment of the rebate due to you once a year, generally at the end of the calendar year.</li>
                  <li>If an insurer does not provide a breakdown showing the amount of basic commissions comprised in the total commissions received by us from the insurer at the time that such commissions are received by us, then the amount of basic commissions shall be deemed to be 45% of the total commissions received by us, for the purpose of computing the amount of rebate to be paid to you (if any).</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>All rebates will be credited directly into your designated bank account less any applicable taxes (including without limitation, goods and services tax) at the prevailing rate, and administrative and bank charges.  It is your obligation to inform us if you wish to use another bank account to receive rebates, and to inform us of changes to your contact details.  Although we will endeavour to notify you if the rebates cannot be to be paid into your designated account for whatever reason, you agree that we are under no obligation to do so.</li>
              <li>Medical expenses may be incurred in connection with medical examinations which may be required in connection with insurance policy applications. You agree to bear the medical expenses if (a) you cancel or fail to take up a policy after the proposal has been accepted by the insurer, or (b) the proposal lapses or is deemed withdrawn by the insurer because you failed to submit all necessary documents required by the insurer.</li>
              <li>
                  If you cancel any insurance policy within the cancellation period set out in the policy document:
                  <ol class="default-ol">
                    <li>any insurance premium paid by you will be refunded after deduction of the applicable medical expenses and administrative fees; and</li>

              </li>
              <li class="default-ol">

How long we keep your personal data depends on the nature of the data, e.g. we keep personal data for at least the duration of the limitation period for bringing claims if the personal data may be required to commence or defend legal proceedings. Certain information may also be retained for longer, e.g. where we are required to do so by law. Typically, our data retention period is from 6 years upwards, depending on the limitation period. In the absence of a need to retain personal data, we will either delete or aggregate it or, if this is not possible then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Anonymised data.</strong>  In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data so that it no longer identifies you, in which case we are entitled to retain and use such anonymised data without restriction, including for data analytics.</li>
