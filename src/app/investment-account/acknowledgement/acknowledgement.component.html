        <span>Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult to liquidate a position, to assess a fair
          price or assess risk exposure. This can happen, for example, where the market for a transaction
          is illiquid or where there is a failure in electronic or telecommunications systems, and where
          there is occurrence of a force majeure event (which shall include without limitation, any form
          of restriction, moratorium or suspension on trading imposed by an exchange, market or other authority
          regulating trading in the transactions). This could also happen for unlisted securities where there
          is no formal market for such securities and are often thinly traded.
