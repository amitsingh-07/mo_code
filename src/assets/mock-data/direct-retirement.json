At maturity, a lump sum benefit including projected bonus (if any) is payable. Premium is payable for either 2 or 5 years. This policy is available for ages 0 to 67. As no medical underwriting is needed, the insurance benefits offered for death, TI and TPD are minimal, which are based on 101% of total premium paid plus projected bonus (if any). You can also attach optional riders like premium waiver to enhance its benefits (available for the 5-year premium plan).",
