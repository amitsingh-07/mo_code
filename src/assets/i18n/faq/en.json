The payout to you is usually 2-3 years long. For single premium plans, the payout to you is one-time only."

                        "ANSWER": "Most policies categorised under the Protection segment such as Term Life, Whole Life, Occupational Disability and Critical Illness insurance plans require applicants to complete a medical underwriting questionnaire. The insurer will offer such policies to those with good health. Those with pre-existing medical conditions may be offered the policy with exclusions or subject to premium loading or, in extreme cases, have their application rejected."

                        "ANSWER": "It depends on the types of insurance policies that you have applied for. Policies categorised under the Protection category require the applicants to undergo medical underwriting. A medical check-up <b>may only be required if the sum assured is of a sizeable amount, if the applicant is of a certain age or if there are existing medical conditions or family history.<br/><br/>Many policies categorised under Savings and Retirement Income segments do not require a medical check-up.</b> This is because the main purpose of the policies is to generate a better return on your premium and less priority to provide for your protection needs."

For two different plans with the same sum assured, the plan with the lower premium will be given a higher ranking.<br/><br/><b>Whole life</b>: This is calculated by taking the ratio of Protection and surrender values at about age 65 over total premium. A higher ranking is given to the plan with higher projected benefits and surrender value at a specific age of 65 over the total premium payable.<br/><br/><b>Long Term Care</b>: This is calculated by taking the ratio of total income payout over premium*. For two different plans with the same payout, the plan with the lower premium will be given a higher ranking.<br/><br/>*Calculations are based on assumptions used for the duration of disability and life expectancy."

                        "ANSWER": "Savings products such as endowment funds are ranked based on the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the total higher projected payout. For plans with payout option over a period of time, the IRR of payout option is used.<br/><br/>IRR is the rate of growth of savings based on the projected benefit and any yearly cash benefit. The higher the IRR, the higher the rank."

                        "QUESTION": "How do you rank Retirement Income products?",
                        "ANSWER": "The ranking is based on the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the projected payout over premium. This is based on the higher non-guaranteed payout based on the benefit illustration provided by the insurer. For life-time payout, there is a harmonization of time periods used.<br/><br/>A higher ranking is given to policies with higher IRR. Higher IRR means that for the same amount of premium, you can expect higher payouts (e.g income payout, maturity benefit), with all things being equal. This ranking is used in most of our retirement product comparisons."

                        "QUESTION": "Is It necessary to have a Will?",
                        "ANSWER": "Having a well-thought out will is always a wise move. The three common advantages are:<br><br><ol type=\"a\"><li><span>You can decide on how your assets will be distributed after your death. Without a will, your assets may not be given to your choice of beneficiaries. This may lead to serious disputes and disharmony among loved ones.</span></li><li><span>You can appoint the right executors and trustees whom you know and trust. Executors and trustees will help to manage your assets and estate affairs after you pass on. This includes distributing assets according to your instructions and paying your debts and liabilities (using your assets).</span></li><li><span>You can appoint a guardian to take care of your children who are below 21 years old. If you have children, it’s important to make sure that they’re always protected and cared for.</span></li></ol>A will is your final act of love for your loved ones. It helps expedite settlement of your estate and avoids unforeseen complications while they are in grief."

                        "ANSWER": "Upon death without a will, you have effectively given up your right to decide how your assets are distributed. Your loved ones may be burdened because:<br><br><ol type=\"a\"><li><span>An administrator, usually a next-of-kin, must step forward to apply for the Letter of Administration before he/she can distribute the estate according to the Intestate Succession Act. As such, there may be serious disagreements as to whom should do so.</span></li><li><span>The process may be more time-consuming as the administrator may not be ready with the required information on the estate, have no time or find it too complicated. There are cases where no one is willing to step forward to be the administrator due to uncertainties in the estate’s liabilities. There are also cases where several people want to be the administrator due to the large amount of assets at stake, sometimes for the wrong reasons.</span></li><li><span>If there are young children involved or if your estate’s value is above a certain threshold, 2 sureties are needed before the court would grant the letter. The sureties must swear an affidavit certifying their worth is equal or more than the total value of your estate.</span></li><li><span>On the unfortunate occasion that both parents pass on at the same time, there may be great uncertainty as to whom should take on the responsibilities of guardianship to your children.</span></li></ol>"

Unfortunately, we are not able to provide this service.</li><li>If you want to give a combination of fixed amounts and percentages. For example, if you have $100,000 of assets and wish to give a fixed amount of $40,000 to your mother and the residual assets ($60,000) to be divided among your siblings by proportion.</li><li>If you want to give away specific assets to a particular beneficiary and your other assets to be divided among your other beneficiaries. For example, you have $100,000 of assets and a house and wish to give away your house to your father and the $100,000 assets to be divided among your siblings.</li><li>If your needs are more complex. For example, if you wish to distribute your estate primarily to your spouse and children, but in the event where the entire family passes on in a common disaster, you might want to re-distribute your estate wishes.</li></ul><br>In MoneyOwl’s will writing process, we will guide you in identifying your beneficiaries and the proportion of estate you intend to distribute, as well as guardians (if you have a young child), executors and trustees.

For example, if you own a property as joint tenants with your spouse, in the event that you pass on, your spouse will inherit the property wholly. For real-estate properties that are held as joint tenants, these properties cannot be passed on through the operation of a will.</span></li><li><span>Generally-speaking, the assets in joint-bank accounts and joint-stock brokerage accounts would also be payable to the surviving account holder. However, due to different clauses with regards to these accounts, in some cases, these assets may form part of the estate to be distributed according to your will or the Intestate Succession Act.</span></li></ol>"

This person or persons must be informed of the location of the will and be able to access it when the need arises. One good place is to keep it together with your insurance policies.
