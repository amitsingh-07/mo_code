                        "QUESTION": "Do I need to undergo medical underwriting?",
                        "ANSWER": "Most policies categorised under the Protection segment such as Term Life, Whole Life, Occupational Disability and Critical Illness insurance plans require applicants to undergo medical underwriting. The insurer will offer such policies to those with good health. Those with pre-existing medical conditions may be offered the policy with exclusions or subject to premium loading or, in extreme cases, have their application rejected.<br/>Recently, <b>there have been an increasing number of policies that do not require</b> medical underwriting; hence the proof of good health is not necessary. Such policies are usually found in the Savings and Retirement Income categories. Insurance policies without the need for medical underwriting offer nominal protection benefits (such as death and Total Permanent Disability). Hence a relatively larger proportion of the policy premiums is used to generate <b>better returns for the policyholder and a smaller proportion to provide</b> for protection needs."

                        "QUESTION": "Do I need to go for a medical check-up?",
                        "ANSWER": "It depends on the types of insurance policies that you have applied for. Policies categorised under the Protection category require the applicants to undergo medical underwriting. A medical check-up <b>may only be required if the sum assured is of a sizeable amount, if the applicant is of a certain age or if there are existing medical conditions or family history.</b><br/><b>Many policies categorised under Savings and Retirement Income segments do not require a medical check-up.</b> This is because the main purpose of the policies is to generate a better return on your premium and less priority to provide for your protection needs."

                        "ANSWER": "<b>Protection products are each ranked according to different criteria as shown below:</b><br/><b>Term Life</b>: This is calculated by taking the ratio of sum assured or projected death or critical illness benefits to total premium. For two different plans with the same sum assured, the plan with the lower premium will be given a higher ranking.<br/><b>Whole life:</b> This is calculated by taking the ratio of Protection and surrender values at about age 65 over total premium. A higher ranking is given to the plan with higher projected benefits and surrender value at a specific age of 65 over the total premium payable. (The sum assured after including the minimum protection value / death benefit is around $200,000 applied for Whole Life Hybrid.)<br/><b>Long Term Care:</b> This is calculated by taking the ratio of total income payout over premium*. For two different plans with the same payout, the plan with the lower premium will be given a higher ranking.<br/>*Calculations are based on assumptions used for the duration of disability and life expectancy."
