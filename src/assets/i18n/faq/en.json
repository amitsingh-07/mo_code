                        "QUESTION": "Do I need to undergo medical underwriting?",
                        "ANSWER": "Most policies categorised under the Protection segment such as Term Life, Whole Life, Occupational Disability and Critical Illness insurance plans require applicants to complete a medical underwriting questionnaire. The insurer will offer such policies to those with good health. Those with pre-existing medical conditions may be offered the policy with exclusions or subject to premium loading or, in extreme cases, have their application rejected."

                        "ANSWER": "It depends on the types of insurance policies that you have applied for. Policies categorised under the Protection category require the applicants to undergo medical underwriting. A medical check-up <b>may only be required if the sum assured is of a sizeable amount, if the applicant is of a certain age or if there are existing medical conditions or family history.<br/><br/>Many policies categorised under Savings and Retirement Income segments do not require a medical check-up.</b> This is because the main purpose of the policies is to generate a better return on your premium and less priority to provide for your protection needs."

                        "QUESTION": "How do you rank Protection products?",
                        "ANSWER": "<b>Protection products are each ranked according to different criteria as shown below:</b><br/><br/><b>Term Life</b>: This is calculated by taking the ratio of sum assured or projected death or critical illness benefits to total premium. For two different plans with the same sum assured, the plan with the lower premium will be given a higher ranking.<br/><br/><b>Whole life</b>: This is calculated by taking the ratio of Protection and surrender values at about age 65 over total premium. A higher ranking is given to the plan with higher projected benefits and surrender value at a specific age of 65 over the total premium payable.<br/><br/><b>Long Term Care</b>: This is calculated by taking the ratio of total income payout over premium*. For two different plans with the same payout, the plan with the lower premium will be given a higher ranking.<br/><br/>*Calculations are based on assumptions used for the duration of disability and life expectancy."

                        "QUESTION": "How do you rank Savings products?",
                        "ANSWER": "Savings products such as endowment funds are ranked based on the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of total payout over premium.<br/><br/>IRR measures the <b>rate of growth</b> of your savings (premiums) to generate the projected Maturity benefit and any Yearly Cash benefits. The higher the IRR, the higher the rank."

                    {
                        "QUESTION": "How do you rank Retirement Income products?",
                        "ANSWER": "The ranking is based on the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of total payout over premium.<br/><br/>2 types of rankings are used for different categories.<br/><br/><b>Internal Rate of Return (IRR) only</b> - a higher ranking is given to policies with higher IRR. Higher IRR means that for the same amount of premium, you can expect higher payouts (e.g income payout, maturity benefit), with all things being equal. This ranking is used in most of our retirement product comparisons.<br/><br/><b>Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and Income Payout Ratio</b> - Income Payout Ratio is computed by dividing the annual income payout by the total premium of the policy. A Higher Income Payout Ratio means that you would get a higher income payout per year for the same premium. A policy which pays a lower annual income but has a higher death benefit would have a lower Income Payout Ratio but a higher IRR. People looking for higher income payouts to fund their lifestyle would prefer products with higher Income Payout Ratio, whilst others who view insurance as a form of investment may be attracted to higher IRR. For some of our retirement product comparisons, a combination of these 2 indicators is used to derive our internal ranking."

There is usually a small discount if you pay your premium yearly as compared to other types of frequency modes."
