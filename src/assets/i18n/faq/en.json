                        "ANSWER": "Most policies categorised under the Protection segment such as Term Life, Whole Life, Occupational Disability and Critical Illness insurance plans require applicants to complete a medical underwriting questionnaire. The insurer will offer such policies to those with good health. Those with pre-existing medical conditions may be offered the policy with exclusions or subject to premium loading or, in extreme cases, have their application rejected."

                        "ANSWER": "It depends on the types of insurance policies that you have applied for. Policies categorised under the Protection category require the applicants to undergo medical underwriting. A medical check-up <b>may only be required if the sum assured is of a sizeable amount, if the applicant is of a certain age or if there are existing medical conditions or family history.<br/><br/>Many policies categorised under Savings and Retirement Income segments do not require a medical check-up.</b> This is because the main purpose of the policies is to generate a better return on your premium and less priority to provide for your protection needs."

For two different plans with the same sum assured, the plan with the lower premium will be given a higher ranking.<br/><br/><b>Whole life</b>: This is calculated by taking the ratio of Protection and surrender values at about age 65 over total premium. A higher ranking is given to the plan with higher projected benefits and surrender value at a specific age of 65 over the total premium payable.<br/><br/><b>Long Term Care</b>: This is calculated by taking the ratio of total income payout over premium*. For two different plans with the same payout, the plan with the lower premium will be given a higher ranking.<br/><br/>*Calculations are based on assumptions used for the duration of disability and life expectancy."

                        "ANSWER": "Savings products such as endowment funds are ranked based on the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the total higher projected payout. For plans with payout option over a period of time, the IRR of payout option is used.<br/><br/>IRR is the rate of growth of savings based on the projected benefit and any yearly cash benefit. The higher the IRR, the higher the rank."

                        "QUESTION": "How do you rank Retirement Income products?",
                        "ANSWER": "The ranking is based on the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of the projected payout over premium. This is based on the higher non-guaranteed payout based on the benefit illustration provided by the insurer. For life-time payout, there is a harmonization of time periods used.<br/><br/>A higher ranking is given to policies with higher IRR. Higher IRR means that for the same amount of premium, you can expect higher payouts (e.g income payout, maturity benefit), with all things being equal. This ranking is used in most of our retirement product comparisons."

It began in 2001 and is operated by the private sector.</p><p>SRS members can contribute any amount up to a yearly cap of $15,300 for Singaporeans and PRs and $35,700 for foreigners.

However, do note that with effect from 1 Jan 2017, there is a cap on personal income tax relief of $80,000 per year of assessment, so if your personal relief have exceeded $80,000 for the year, further contribution to SRS would not attract any tax benefit.</p><p>Investment returns are accumulated tax-free.

Only 50% of the withdrawals <strong>after</strong> the statutory retirement age* from SRS are taxable (referred to as a “50% tax concession”).</p><p><small>*The statutory retirement age is the prevailing age when you made your first SRS contribution.

For example, you will get tax relief for contributions made in year 2018 and the tax relief will be given in Year of Assessment 2019, if you are regarded as a tax resident in Year of Assessment 2018.</p><p>Tax relief is granted automatically by the tax authority (IRAS), based on information provided by the SRS operators.</p>"

The three common advantages are:<br><br><ol type=\"a\"><li><span>You can decide on how your assets will be distributed after your death. Without a will, your assets may not be given to your choice of beneficiaries. This may lead to serious disputes and disharmony among loved ones.</span></li><li><span>You can appoint the right executors and trustees whom you know and trust. Executors and trustees will help to manage your assets and estate affairs after you pass on. This includes distributing assets according to your instructions and paying your debts and liabilities (using your assets).</span></li><li><span>You can appoint a guardian to take care of your children who are below 21 years old. If you have children, it’s important to make sure that they’re always protected and cared for.</span></li></ol>A will is your final act of love for your loved ones.

                        "ANSWER": "Upon death without a will, you have effectively given up your right to decide how your assets are distributed. Your loved ones may be burdened because:<br><br><ol type=\"a\"><li><span>An administrator, usually a next-of-kin, must step forward to apply for the Letter of Administration before he/she can distribute the estate according to the Intestate Succession Act. As such, there may be serious disagreements as to whom should do so.</span></li><li><span>The process may be more time-consuming as the administrator may not be ready with the required information on the estate, have no time or find it too complicated. There are cases where no one is willing to step forward to be the administrator due to uncertainties in the estate’s liabilities. There are also cases where several people want to be the administrator due to the large amount of assets at stake, sometimes for the wrong reasons.</span></li><li><span>If there are young children involved or if your estate’s value is above a certain threshold, 2 sureties are needed before the court would grant the letter. The sureties must swear an affidavit certifying their worth is equal or more than the total value of your estate.</span></li><li><span>On the unfortunate occasion that both parents pass on at the same time, there may be great uncertainty as to whom should take on the responsibilities of guardianship to your children.</span></li></ol>"

Unfortunately, we are not able to provide this service.</li><li>If you want to give a combination of fixed amounts and percentages. For example, if you have $100,000 of assets and wish to give a fixed amount of $40,000 to your mother and the residual assets ($60,000) to be divided among your siblings by proportion.</li><li>If you want to give away specific assets to a particular beneficiary and your other assets to be divided among your other beneficiaries. For example, you have $100,000 of assets and a house and wish to give away your house to your father and the $100,000 assets to be divided among your siblings.</li><li>If your needs are more complex. For example, if you wish to distribute your estate primarily to your spouse and children, but in the event where the entire family passes on in a common disaster, you might want to re-distribute your estate wishes.</li><li>If you are translating this website for a person who does not understand English, please note that the person is unable to use our will writing service. This is because, in addition to the will having to be interpreted for the person in a language that he understands, the sign-off portion where he and the witnesses sign off needs to be amended to state that the content of the will had been explained in his language and that he fully understands the content of the will. We are not able to make such amendments and any handwritten amendment could make the will null and void.</li></ul><br>In MoneyOwl’s will writing process, we will guide you in identifying your beneficiaries and the proportion of estate you intend to distribute, as well as guardians (if you have a young child), executors and trustees.

                        "QUESTION": "How are my returns calculated?",
                        "ANSWER": "The total returns are based on time-weighted return approach, which is calculated by multiplying the daily returns of your portfolio and linking them together to show how the returns are compounded over time. It shows you how much $1 of your investment would have grown throughout your investment period, without considering the size and timing of interim cash inflows or outflows. This is in line with how fund managers measure the performance of their funds. <br/><br/>Mathematically, if the period 1 return on your investment is represented by r<sub>1</sub>, and period 2 is represented by r<sub>2</sub> and so on, the Time-Weighted Return is determined by the formula below: <br/>Total Returns = [(1+r<sub>1</sub>) (1+r<sub>2</sub>) (1+r<sub>3</sub>) (1+r<sub>4</sub>) .... (1+r<sub>n</sub>)] – 1 <br/><br/><u>Example:</u><br/>Suppose Peter invests $10,000 into a portfolio on 1 Jan. On 1 July, his portfolio is valued at $11,500 and at this point he adds another $1,000 bringing his portfolio value to $12,500 ($11,500 + $1,000). By the end of the year, the portfolio has decreased in value to $12,000. <br/><br/>Period Return (1 Jan to 30 Jun) = ($11,500 - $10,000)/$10,000 = 15% <br/>Period Return (1 Jul to 31 Dec) = ($12,000 - $12,500)/$12,500 = -4% <br/><br/>Therefore, the Time-Weighted Return during this entire period (1 Jan to 31 Dec) is 10.4%, which is computed by geometrically linking the returns of the two periods, i.e. [(1+0.15) (1-0.04)] - 1 = 10.4%"

MoneyOwl may, at its discretion, rebalance the portfolio about once a quarter, upon meaningful deviation from strategic asset allocation or upon review of the asset allocation of the portfolio."

The exact price at which you will transact is therefore not known at the point of your placing an order. The price of the fund that you see on screen is from the previous one or two business days before, depending on the fund, not the actual price at which you will transact. The actual price at which you will transact will only be known one or two business days later.</p><p>For example:<br/>You redeem $100 of the portfolio (T day). The indicative price of one of the portfolio’s underlying funds, Fund A, is $1 on T day. Based on this indicative price, you will redeem $100 / $1 = 100 units. The actual price of the fund at the end of T day is $1.01. This price is only reflected on T+1 day. You will transact at $1.01 and your redemption proceeds will be $1.01 x 100 = $101.</p>"

                        "ANSWER": "<p><ol type='a'><li>  Resource-based planning vs Goal-based planning</br></br><span>Common approach to financial planning is goal based. Goal-based planning for children education and retirement require one to know what you want and identify any gap based on your existing resources to result in a recommendation plan. From our experience, most people find it difficult to conceptualise what or how much they want for the future. Rather it is more meaningful to know how much they can have in the future with what is now available. </span></br></br><span class='text-underline text-italic'>As an example:</span></br></br><span>In goal-based retirement planning, you are asked 2 key questions:</span></br></br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;when you would like to retire; and</span></br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;how much you want in your retirement.</span></br></br><span>Depending on your answers, an analysis and recommendation plan is created. Disadvantages of this approach is that many people don’t know when they can retire, let alone how much they can or should have. Hence any resultant solution may not be most appropriate.</span></br></br><span>At MoneyOwl, we use resource-based planning. You are asked one key question:</span></br></br><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;when would you like to retire</span></br></br><span>An analysis-cum-recommendation is developed based on the resources you have and the various retirement scenarios should you increase your savings or delay your retirement. In this way, you are likely to make better informed decisions and the resultant solution would be more in line with your current lifestyle and future needs.</span></li></br><li> Integration with national schemes</br></br><span>Our  recommendations  incorporate  national  schemes  into  your  financial  plan  in  a  holistic  and sophisticated  way  using  our  proprietary  MoneyOwl  CPF  Analyser  to  project  your  CPF  balances, considering your contributions, mortgage payments, as well as the complex rules and limits in the CPF system. This will provide you with an estimate of what your CPF LIFE payout will be with a high degree of accuracy.</span></br></br><li>Fit-for-purpose, low cost solution, bigger savings</li></br><span>Our recommendations are use cost-effective solutions, fit-for-purpose rather than expensive financial products. For insurance gaps, our recommendation typically uses low-cost term policy, and with up to 50%  rebate  of  basic  commission  in  cash,  it  brings  down  your  cost  of  insurance  even  lower.  Our investment  solution  is  based  on  time-tested  principles  of  asset-allocation  focus  and  market-based returns, implementing using low-cost instrument and the discipline of staying invested.</span></li></br></br><li>Conflict-free financial advice</br></br><span>Our advisers are fully salaried, conflict-free and competent. Most of our advisers are accredited Associate Wealth Planners or Certified Financial Planner by the Financial Planning Association of Singapore. Your client adviser will understand your priorities, ascertain your objectives, then guide and encourage you towards taking positive action to achieve your financial goals.</span></li></ol></p>"
