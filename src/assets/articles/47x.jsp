<p>Now that I am married, I gifted out ang baos (red packets) for the first time this Lunar New Year. It was wonderful to spread the joy and see my little cousins light up when they received them.  </p>
<p>I still recall that when I was a kid, I was very excited to open the ang baos I received during each Chinese New Year. I would count, double count the money I received and ask my parents to deposit into my POSB account. </p>
<p>This same bank account is still with me and for many years, it was the only bank account I had which I performed all my financial transactions with. All that I have earned from my part-time work during the school holidays, allowance that I received in army and internships stints went into the POSB account. </p>
<p>If you are a parent and are looking at setting up a bank account for your child, there are many available now.  Setting up one for your child provides many benefits: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Gives your child ownership to manage a sum of money at a young age</li>
  <li>Provides an opportunity for you to educate your child on good money habits of saving money</li>
  <li>Early start for your child to learn about the benefits of compound interest and how they can put their money to better use</li>
</ol>
