<p>
  Congratulations on your  graduation! You have completed almost 2 decades of formal schooling. I savored  the time when I graduated, I was on my own to forge my own path ahead.</p>
 <p>Receiving my first full-time pay was  exciting but the excitement faded as quickly as it came. Financial  responsibilities of planning for my wedding, a home and kids soon came my way.</p>
  <p>As a young graduate, you are required  to make your most important financial decisions at still a young age.</p>
  <p>I wish I knew these money tips  before I started working.</p><br>
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>1. Budget</strong></h3>

<p>The only way to not get into debt  is to spend less than what we earn. Budgeting is so important yet often  neglected by most of us.</p>
  <em>Useful  hacks: </em>
<ol>
  <li>Budget  your monthly salary into four areas: monthly expenses, savings (eg. wedding,  renovation), emergency fund, spare cash (ad-hoc expenses)</li>
  <li>Account  sufficiently for ad-hoc expenses. It could be the ad-hoc birthday treat that  came up, an unexpected taxi ride or a course that you want to sign up for.</li>
  <li>Do  not stretch yourself too thin and do not spend more than what you have budgeted for.</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>2. Automate  Banking Accounts</strong></h3>

<p>This ensures that we stick to our  budget.<br>
  With new bank accounts (Eg. <a href="https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/accounts/360-articles/saving-more-with-bonus-rates.html">OCBC 360</a> and <a href="https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/deposits/chequeing/one_account.html">UOB One</a>) that give us higher  interest by depositing our salary and making a minimum spending, we are given incentives to save and spend all from the same account. <br>
  This could lead to overspending  and we could be better off not earning from this extra interest.</p>
  <em>Useful  hacks:</em>
<ol>
  <li>Setup  four bank accounts for the four areas you have budgeted for </li>
  <li>Direct  your salary into one account and set an automated transfer on when your salary  is credited each month to the other 3 other accounts.</li>
  <li>Ensure  that you do not have any ATM, debit or credit card access to your savings emergency  fund bank accounts. It was so easy for me to touch these accounts when I had  access to them!</li>
</ol>

<br><h3 class="primary-color"><strong>3. Savings</strong></h3>

<p>This account allows me to save up  for big-ticket items that are coming up. Even if you are single now, it is  important to save. You should be financially prepared when the love of your  life appears!</p>
  <em>Useful  info: </em>
<ol>
  <li>A  wedding in Singapore is more costly than what most people think. One couple in Singapore had a  dream $110k wedding and ended up in severe debt. An entire wedding  celebration with a banquet at a hotel can easily come up to <a href="https://sgyounginvestment.blogspot.sg/2014/03/how-much-money-is-needed-to-get-married.html">at least $40,000</a>. Remember that A  Wedding is a Day; Marriage is a Lifetime. </li>
  <li><a href="https://dollarsandsense.sg/how-much-does-it-really-cost-to-renovate-a-hdb-flat/">The  average amount spent on renovations is $56,000 in 2014.</a> Together with your  wedding celebration, this is a large sum of cash to save up for.</li>
  <li>If  you are looking to purchase a car, you would need to set aside at least 40% of the  purchase price in cash. A new Chery J3 requires a deposit  of at least $30,000. </li>
</ol>
<br><h3 class="primary-color"><strong>4. Emergency  Funds</strong></h3>

<p>Many people underestimate the  value of having emergency funds set aside. We need extra funds to tap on for an  unexpected medical expenses of a loved one and to tide over in the event of a  retrenchment. </p>
  <em>Useful  hacks:</em>
<ol>
  <li>A  good guide is to save up 6 months of your monthly salary so that there is  enough to tap on in an unexpected event. </li>
  <li>Consider  setting a portion of your emergency funds in Singapore Savings Bonds by the  Singapore Government.  ï¿½Aim to grow your emergency fund as your  salary increases.</li>
</ol>

<br><h3 class="primary-color"><strong>5. Insurance</strong></h3>

<p>This allows me to provide for my  loved ones who are dependent on me financially. In the event of an illness or a  disability, I will not be a financial burden to anyone.</p>
  <em>Useful  hacks:</em>
<ul class="bluedot">
  <li>Use term insurance to adequately insure  yourself. Most of us do not need insurance for our entire lives, our dependents  would no longer be dependent on us financially at a later point in our lives. </li>
  <li>Always compare products from the  different insurers,  the price differences between the different companies are much greater than  what you expect.</li>
  <li>Ask  your insurance advisor how he/she is being remunerated. Does your advisor earn  more by selling you one product over another?</li>
</ul>
<br><h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Investments?</strong></h3>
 <p>While the world of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investing.asp" target="_blank" title="investing">investing</a> and  possibility of high returns seem exciting, it is critical that you do not dive  into them until you have the above five financial areas planned for. Investing is  for long-term and we should only invest if we have spare funds that we do not  need for 10 years to ride the market volatility. </p>
  <p>By implementing the above money  hacks and if you are debt-free, you would have started off on a sound financial  footing. </p>
  <p>The journey to financial  independence is a marathon and not a 100m dash. Plan well and you have won half  the battle!</p>
