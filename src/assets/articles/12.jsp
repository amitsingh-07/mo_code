	<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Start Planning Early</strong></h3>
	<p>There is immense joy that comes with parenthood. While we savour the joy our children bring into our lives, we are also constantly thinking about their futures. In particular, their education is the biggest concern and is a major financial commitment. </p>
	<br>

	<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>First, Decide How Much to Save</strong></h3>
	<p>Before deciding which product to buy, you must first establish how much you need to save. We have developed an Education Savings Calculator to help you determine how much you need to save towards your child's University education. You would need to input the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Number of years before your child enters University</li>
		<li>Intended course of study</li>
		<li>How much to provide</li>
	</ul>
		
	<p><a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-financial-products/insurance/types-of-insurance/life-insurance/types-of-life-insurance/endowment-insurance.aspx" target="_blank">Endowment policies</a> are suitable for parents who do not prefer to take too much risk and yet want better returns than what the banks provide. There are now endowment plans specifically designed for children's education, which spread the maturity payout over the University years instead of just providing a lump sum at the end of the policy. </p>

	<p>The following diagram gives a sample of how much one would need to save in the endowment plan for a child entering University in the next 5, 10, 15 and 20 years. Clearly, the more time you have to save for your child's education, the less you need to save every month. It pays to start early. </p>

	<br>
	<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>How Should You Choose?</strong></h3>
	<br>

	<ol>
	  	<li><strong><em>Are the returns good?</em></strong>
		  	<p>Since your objective is savings, getting a good return should be your biggest consideration. All five plans provide projected returns of more than 3.5%, which is a good return for endowment plans.</p>
			</li>
			<br/>
	  	<li>
	  		<strong><em>Do you need the flexibility for some payouts before University age?</em></strong>
	  		<p>Think about whether you would like to have the option of small payouts at significant milestones in your child's education journey to reward him/her with vacations or gifts, and whether you want these small payouts only closer to the University years (Aviva's MyEduPlan or Manulife's Educate) or even earlier (NTUC Income's VivoChild).</p>

	  		<p>If you do not need to spend the money, these payouts can always be deposited with the insurer to earn a good interest (around 3%, subject to the insurer's discretion) and can be withdrawn anytime. Such liquidity is an advantage, but if it is not of paramount importance, you may consider AXA's Early Saver Plus or Tokio Marine's Kidstart plans.</p>
			</li>
			<br/>
	  	<li>
	  		<strong><em>How long are you willing and able to pay premiums for? </em></strong>
	  		<p>NTUC Income Vivochild offers the best returns, but it requires you to save over a longer period. If you prefer to save over a shorter duration, the other 3 plans offer various options to choose from.</p>
	  	</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Our Verdict</strong></h3>
	<p>Based on the above example, NTUC Income VivoChild seems to be the most attractive plan, because it offers the flexibility of payouts before University age as well as choice of premium duration, all while offering one of the highest returns of the five.</p>
