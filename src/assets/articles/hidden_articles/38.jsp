<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Chapter 2 - How Long Do We Need Insurance Coverage For?</strong></h3><br>
<h3 class="primary-color">Death/Total  Permanent Disability (TPD) Coverage</h3><br>
<p>Why does one buy insurance that pays upon death/TPD? For  most people, the primary reason is to replace loss of income for the family and  dependants when the income earner is no longer around. There are other  secondary reasons why people buy this type of&nbsp;insurance but we will  discuss that later in this chapter. For now, let&rsquo;s focus on people whom buy  insurance for the purpose of income replacement. For this same group of people,  the following situations are when such insurance is not or no longer needed:</p>
<br>
<p><strong>a. When there are no more dependants</strong></p>
<p>There will come a time in our life when we have no more dependants or they have become independent of us. Such situations are when:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
   <li>Our children have all grown up and are working. Our parents are no longer around as they have predeceased us.</li>
   <li>We are single and our parents, whom were dependent on us, have predeceased us.</li>
   <li>Our children have all grown up and are working. Our spouse is working and can support himself/herself with his/her own income plus accumulated assets.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p><strong>b. And when our earned income is no longer needed</strong></p>
<p>There will also come a time in our life where we will no  longer earn or need an income. Such situations are when:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>We have retired. During this stage of our life, we will be living off our <a href="https://www.diyinsurance.com.sg/portal/compare/retirement-income" target="_blank" title="Compare Retirement Plans Now">retirement</a> nest egg and our children if any, would be independent of us. If death occurs, there is no income to replace as we have already retired.</li>
  <li>We have sufficient assets to fund the family lifestyle, even upon our demise. Assets can come in the form of property investments, stocks and shares, business and so on and so forth.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>So if we are buying insurance that pays upon death/TPD, for  the purpose of replacing income loss, when we don&rsquo;t have or no longer have  dependants and when our earned income is no longer needed, there is no need for  coverage. Our need for this kind of insurance is therefore temporary and not  permanent.</p>
<br><br><h3 class="primary-color">Dread  Disease/Critical Illness Coverage</h3><br>
<p>Why does one buy insurance that pays upon diagnosis of a  dread disease (a.k.a critical illness)? There are 2 primary reasons:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>To replace income loss as one might not be able to work due to illness</li>
  <li>To pay for the cost of alternative medicine and care that may not be covered by hospital plans</li>
</ol>
<p>So if we are buying it for the purpose of replacing income  loss, the following situations are when such dread disease insurance is not or  no longer needed:</p><br>
<p><strong>a. When there are no more dependants</strong></p>
<p>There will come a time in our life when we have no more  dependants or they have become independent of us. Such situations are when:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Our children have all grown up and are working. Our parents are no longer around as they have predeceased us.</li>
  <li>We are single and our parents have predeceased us</li>
  <li>Our children have all grown up and are working. Our spouse is working and can support himself/herself with his/her own income plus accumulated assets</li>
</ol><br>
<p><strong>b. When our earned income is no longer needed</strong></p>
<p>There will also come a time in our life where we will no longer earn or need an income. Such situations are when:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>We have retired. During this stage of our life, we will be living off our retirement nest egg and our children if any, would be independent of us. If death occurs, there is no income to replace as we have already retired.</li>
  <li>We have sufficient asset to fund the family lifestyle, even upon our demise. Assets can come in the form of property investments, stocks and shares, business and so on and so forth.</li>
</ol>
<p>And if we are buying it for the purpose of paying for the  cost of alternative medicine and care that may not be covered by hospital  plans, we will likely need this dread disease insurance for as long as we want  it. When we no longer want this option, then we don&rsquo;t need this kind of  insurance anymore.</p>
<br><p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>So if we are buying insurance that pays upon diagnosis of a  dread disease, for the purpose of replacing income loss, there will come a time  when we will no longer need it. This is when we don&rsquo;t have or no longer have  dependants and when our earned income is no longer needed. Our need for this  kind of insurance is therefore temporary and not permanent.</p>
<p>But if we are buying it for the purpose of paying for the  cost of alternative medicine and care that may not be covered by hospital  plans, we will need this kind of insurance for as long as we want it. Our need  for this kind of insurance is permanent and not temporary.&nbsp;</p>
<br><br><h3 class="primary-color">Some Other Reasons Why People Buy Insurance That Pays Upon Death and/or Diagnosis of a Dread Disease</h3>
<br><ol>
  <li><strong>Paying off liabilities such as mortgage loans, car loan and other liabilities</strong><br><br>
  	<p>Most of us will have some liabilities such as mortgage loans  or car loans. When we pass away, we would want to ensure that these liabilities  can be fully taken care of, so that we do not leave behind financial burdens  for our loved ones to undertake. The good thing about loans is that there is an  end point to them. There will be a day when they will be fully repaid. So if we  are buying insurance to allow our family to pay off these liabilities in the  event of our unfortunate demise, there will come a time when we no longer need  it, because the loans have been fully taken care of. Once again, our need for  this kind of insurance is therefore temporary and not permanent.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Ability to fund children&rsquo;s education  upon demise</strong><br><br>
  	<p>For those of us with children, we would have plans to  accumulate towards funding their tertiary education. However, the concern is  when death occurs, we may not have accumulated enough funds yet. Buying  insurance to provide an immediate lump sum upon demise is useful. But if we  survive till the time when the kids have graduated, such insurance coverage is  no longer necessary. Once again, our need for this kind of insurance is temporary  and not permanent.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Legacy planning &amp; gifting</strong><br><br>
  	<p>For more affluent individuals, many buy insurance for the  purpose of legacy planning (leaving behind financial wealth for the family) or  gifting, usually for philanthropic reasons upon their demise. If we are buying  insurance for these reasons, we will need it for as long as we live. It is a  permanent need. However, we need to mention that there are many other ways of  legacy planning and gifting that goes beyond insurance. But it is usually the  more affluent that will consider it. Some common ways of gifting is through  setting up a trust and putting into the trust properties, investment funds,  etc. Of course, insurance has the advantage of setting aside a small capital  (in the form of premiums) in exchange for a huge death benefit. One can also  place the insurance policy into the trust for the purpose of distribution,  gifting upon demise.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Taking care of children with special  needs</strong><br><br>
  	<p>For those that may have children with special needs, we may  want to ensure that our children can be well taken care of when we predecease  them. Insurance is one way of solving this problem. There are 2 approaches to  using insurance in this case.&nbsp;</p>
	<ol type="a">
	  	<li>We can buy an insurance that covers  us for as long as we live, so that when we pass on, the insurance proceeds will  be able to take care of our children.</li>
		<li>We can buy an insurance that covers  us till we retire. Meanwhile, we can accumulate towards an amount that will be  sufficient to take care of our children, if death occurs after our <a href="https://www.diyinsurance.com.sg/portal/compare/retirement-income" target="_blank" title="Compare Retirement Plans Now ">retirement</a>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>So for this need, our need for insurance coverage can be a  temporary or permanent need.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Providing for alternative medicine  and care for children, in the event if they are diagnosed with a dread disease</strong><br><br>
  	<p>One of the worries of parents is that our children may be  diagnosed with a dread disease. So if we are buying insurance for the purpose  of paying for the cost of alternative medicine and care that is not covered by  hospital plans, we will likely need a dread disease insurance for as long as we  want it. For this kind of coverage, our need is a permanent need.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Replacement of a keyman in an organization</strong><br><br>
  	<p>In business, it is often difficult to replace the loss of a  key man, such as a CEO or a key employee. The loss of a key man can result in  potential business losses. The payout from insurance can replace this loss,  until another suitable employee is found. If we are buying insurance for this  purpose, we only need to cover the key man till his planned retirement or when  he no longer works for the organization. Our need for this kind of insurance is  therefore temporary.<br>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Funding a buy-sell agreement contract between business partners </strong><br><br>
  	<p>In business, the death of a business partners can create  havoc for the organization, especially so if the surviving owner may have to  work with the family members, who have just inherited the shares of the  deceased partner. One of the common solutions to solve this, is by way of a  buy-sell agreement between partners, whereby both partners agree to sell to  each other their shares upon one of their demise. But in order for the  surviving partner to have immediate cash to buy the shares, the partners buy an  insurance on each of the partners&rsquo; life. When there is a demise, the insurance  paid out will be given to the deceased partner&rsquo;s family, in exchange for his  shares. If we are buying insurance for this purpose. We will need insurance  coverage until the planned exit of the partners from the business. Our need for  insurance in this case can be temporary or permanent, depending on when the  partners planned for their exit. Although in our experience working with  business clients, the need is usually temporary.</p>

<small class="text-muted"><em>Table 2.1: Types of insurance needs and whether temporary or permanent?</em></small>
<br><br>
<p><strong>What if I know that I  only need insurance coverage temporarily but I don&rsquo;t mind paying more for coverage  for my entire life?</strong></p>
<p>Today if we have unlimited resources, and insurance needs  are our only concern, we can buy as much insurance for as long a cover as we  want, even if we don&rsquo;t need it. Unfortunately because we have limited income,  but unlimited planning needs, we really need to prioritise our needs. For every  extra dollar we pay to buy insurance that we don&rsquo;t need, it simply means we  will have lesser money to save and invest towards our life goals, such as  <a href="https://www.diyinsurance.com.sg/portal/compare/retirement-income" target="_blank" title="Compare Retirement Plans Now"></a>retirement and accumulating towards children&rsquo;s education.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Remember that when we plan for ourselves financially, we are really planning to  live and not to die! We buy insurance as a &ldquo;contingency plan&rdquo;. We don&rsquo;t really  want to use it. We have insurance, just in case if the unforeseen happens, and  we are no longer able to earn an income, an insurance payout allows us and our  family to carry on with life.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So if we buy so much insurance, and especially coverage that  we don&rsquo;t need, leaving insufficient financial resources to save for our life  goals, the only way for our family to achieve their life goals is to delay the  achievement of these goals (such as retirement) or for us to die so that the  insurance payout will fund our lives! What a joke that will be, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>So, buy insurance that takes care of your higher priority  needs first, then save towards our life goals, such as retirement and  children&rsquo;s education. And if we still have budget, we then buy the extra  insurance that we may not need but want.</p>
<br><br><h3 class="primary-color">Conclusion</h3>
<br><p>So how long do we need insurance cover? Based on the above  discussion, we will realise that in almost all situations, especially the  higher priority planning needs, we don&rsquo;t need it forever. We only need it for a  period of our life, when we are still earning an income, or have dependants  that need the income. The only main exception, is, if we are buying insurance  for the purpose of paying for alternative medicine or care. And this is  provided that we want this option and have a conviction for the use of alternative  medicine.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  In other circumstances where we need insurance cover for as  long as we live, such as&nbsp;<br>
  <ol>
  	<li>Legacy  planning and gifting</li>
  	<li>Taking  care of children with special needs</li>
  	<li>Funding a buy-sell agreement  between business owners (which in many instances, could&nbsp;also be a  temporary need)</li>
  </ol>
<p>These are either not higher priority planning needs or they  are unique circumstances for the minority.<br>
  Advisers may argue that clients and not advisers, should determine what their  higher priority planning needs are. We submit that as professional advisers,  there are times when we must exercise our responsibilities and obligations to  our clients, in advising them what is right for them. If we are always giving  in to clients every want, we are not advisers, but we become salespeople.&nbsp;</p>
<br><br>

<!-- chapter3 -->
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Chapter 3 - How Much Insurance Do We Need?</strong></h3><br>
<p>We do not think it is right to  just use the rule of thumb way (such as 10% of your income going into insurance  or insure yourself up to 10 times of your annual income) when it comes to  financial planning and in this case, insurance planning. We are convinced that  a better way is to understand the needs of each individual. Some of the factors  that differ from person to person, that will affect how much insurance a pers<a name="_GoBack"></a>on needs are:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>How much of our monthly income do we need to replace       on our unfortunate demise?</li>
  <li>How many years do we need to replace this       income for?</li>
  <li>Do we need to pay off our liabilities (such as       mortgage) upon our demise?</li>
  <li>Do we need to fund our children&rsquo;s tertiary       education, even after our demise?</li>
  <li>What is our current insurance situation and       how much assets do we have now?</li>
</ol>
<p>And of course, there could be  additional factors, depending on our situation.</p>
<p>Using a case study of 2 different  individual profiles of Tony and Peter, we did a needs analysis for them to  determine their needs if death or <a href="https://www.diyinsurance.com.sg/portal/compare/protection" target=" _blank" title="Compare Protection Plans Now">total and permanent disability</a> were to occur.</p>
