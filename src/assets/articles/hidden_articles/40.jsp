<p>Congratulations, for reading up till this chapter. By now, we will begin to understand why <a href="/articles/html?title=Why+Term+Insurance?+&art_id=42" target="_blank" title="Why Term Plans">term plans</a> are the most suitable plans to use for our higher priority needs. But the question we might have on our mind is: if term is more suitable, why then are there more whole life plans being sold, rather than term plans?</p>
<br>
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Chapter 5 - Why are More Whole Life plans sold Rather than Term Plans?</strong></h3><br>
<p>To begin answering this question, let us first verify if this statement is indeed true: Are there more whole life plans being sold in Singapore rather than term plans? </p>

<br><br>
<p>From the table above, we can see that prior to 2005, there are indeed a higher proportion of whole life plans being sold rather than <a href="/articles/html?title=Why+Term+Insurance?+&art_id=42" target="_blank" title="Why Term Plans">term plans</a>. In fact, though not shown in this table (but we can refer to MAS website), if we go back even to the mid 90s, we will see that there are also a higher proportion of whole life plans being sold. This is not surprising because term plans weren't popular back then. </p>
<p>In 2005, the data was skewed as we can see a big spike in the proportion of term plans being sold (68.91% of the total non-linked plans). According to Life Insurance Association (LIA), it is understood that the privatisation of Dependent Protection Scheme (DPS) has caused the huge increase. It used to be that DPS was administered under CPF Board. But in 2005, it was privatised and all CPF members who bought DPS would either purchased through Great Eastern Life or NTUC Income. This explain a jump in the proportion of term plans sold in 2005 as DPS are term plans.</p>
<p>But one thing is clear, from 2000 onwards, we see a change in trend, the proportion of whole life plans being sold decreased steadily as term plans picked up pace. </p>
<p>One more thing to note: From 2013 onwards, term plans sales started coming down, with no increase in the proportion of sales of whole life plans. Where did the decrease in proportion of sales in term plans go to? We will notice an increase in percentage in the category &ldquo;others&rdquo;, which we could not find an explanation on what it constitutes on the MAS website. </p>
<br><br>
<h3 class="primary-color">Summary</h3><br>
<p>It is true that more whole life plans (relative to term plans) were sold in the past. However, from 2000 onwards, the proportion of sales of whole life plans started dropping. Instead, the proportion of term plan sales started increasing steadily. We believe the reasons why this is so because:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
 <li>A lot more were written about term versus whole life insurance. When we started writing about term insurance in 2003, we faced a lot of flak from the industry. At that time, very few, in fact, almost no one in the industry wrote about term insurance. Today, we see journalists, magazine writers, and financial bloggers writing more and more about term insurance. Even some advisers are beginning to see the advantages of term over whole life insurance. </li>
 <li>Consumers are more educated today and are beginning to understand the advantages of term plans. Again, since 2003, almost all our clients who passed through <a href="https://www.providend.com/" title="Providend" target="_blank">Providend</a> and DIYInsurance bought term insurance through us.</li>
 <li>The insurers are coming out with better term products with more competitive prices.</li>
</ol>
<p>So why is it so, that in the past and even now, many people still buy whole life insurance? Besides the fact that many consumers and advisers out there are still not aware of the advantages of term versus whole life insurance, we believe that the key reason is because of compensation. What do we mean?</p>
<p>Using the same case study of Tony and Peter, we look at the various insurance plans that we can use to meet their needs.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion 4: It is cheaper to buy a term plan to cover your need of income replacement due to critical illness. If you want the option of providing alternative medicine and care, buy a term policy and a whole life plan separately. Alternatively, if you are prepared to pay a bit more, you may also consider getting a whole life hybrid instead to take care of both needs.</strong></p>
<br><br>
<h3 class="primary-color">So what do the 4 conclusions tell us?</h3>
<br>
<p>For all our higher priority needs, not only does it make sense to buy a term plan (as we have explained in chapter 4, in terms of commission, we also pay (and agents/advisers get) lower commission. You only consider a whole life or a whole life hybrid plan if you want the option of alternative medicine and care.</p>
<p>We want to clarify that we are not saying that all agents and financial advisers out there are simply selling whole life plans/whole life hybrid to consumers because they are paid better. In fact, we know that there are agents and advisers who do the right thing, even though they are paid lesser. These agents/advisers truly look after the interest of the clients and they need to be recognised.<br>
 However, the truth is, compensation does drives behaviour. As long as there is a huge difference in commission between term, whole life, and whole life hybrid, there is always that temptation for us to sell products that pay better, especially so, if sales awards, incentives, promotions are tied to the amount of sales we bring in. </p>
<p>As we have painstakingly explained, for our higher level needs, our need for insurance is temporary. And for us to be fully covered, the premium for whole life plans are so expensive that most of us will not be able to afford it. Why then is it so that before 2005, there is a higher proportion of sales in whole life plans rather than <a href="/articles/html?title=Why+Term+Insurance?+&art_id=42" target="_blank" title="Why Term Plans">term plans</a>? And because a lot more people are sold whole life plans, many would have just bought what they can afford in terms of premiums and as a result, they are not fully covered. Perhaps this explains why we are an underinsured nation.</p>
