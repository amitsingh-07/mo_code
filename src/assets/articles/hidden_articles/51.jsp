<p>When you buy your insurance with DIY, we  lower your cost by rebating a sizeable portion of the salesperson&rsquo;s commissions  back to you. Because of this, DIYInsurance is probably the most cost-effective  way of buying insurance. </p>
<p> In our business, trust is of paramount importance.  So when we say that we will rebate the commissions back to our clients, we must  make sure that we return the amount accurately and on time. However, as  insurance companies can pay commissions over many years, rebating it back to  thousands of clients can be complex. Over the past decade, we have put in place  a reliable finance process supported by IT. And together with my team of  Executive, we have ensured that all of our clients have received their rebates  on time. It is one thing to say that we rebate and it is another to make sure  it happens. At DIYInsurance, we make sure it does happen because honesty and  trust is very important to us. </p>
<p>This is just one benefit of using DIYInsurance.  Our team helping you in the background, you are never alone. We have been  serving clients since 2003 and we continue to serve you today via DIYInsurance.</p>
