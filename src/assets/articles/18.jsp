<p>The journey to begin to invest is a difficult path on its  own. Most people are attracted by the high returns that investments could potentially provide but fail to understand the risks of investing. Many  investors jump into the sea of investments and end up drowning. Fear strikes me  when my peers get overly excited about &ldquo;investment opportunities&rdquo; and when they  are too eager to begin investing before laying the foundations.</p>
<p>As with everything in life, we prioritise and take care  of what is <strong><u>important</u></strong> first. </p>
<br>
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Debts, Emergency Savings &amp; Essential Expenses</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Debts:</strong> In our financial plans, we know that we first have to take care of our <strong>Debts.</strong> Do you know that many credit cards effective interest rate are at 24.9% and above per annum now? It would not be  logical for us to invest before clearing these debts, loans and cash lines with  high interest rates. It is not possible to achieve 24.9% investment returns per  annum consistently.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>Emergency Savings:</strong> An <strong>Emergency Savings</strong> of at least 6 months of our monthly expenses is recommended because  this take cares in an event of a stoppage of our income such as an unexpected  retrenchment. The emergency savings is also critical to cover unexpected  expenses such as medical expenses for our loved ones, household, vehicle  repairs and other unfortunate events. </p>
<p><strong>Important expenses:</strong> If we expect expenses coming up such as  hosting a wedding banquet, a house renovation or the birth of a child, we  should save up for these expenses in cash. (These expenses could easily add up  to S$60,000 and more in cash requirement for a couple) We cannot afford to  invest and be forced to sell off our investments at a low when the bills are  due. </p>
<br>
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Protection from Financial Risk</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Insurance:</strong> To protect ourselves from financial risk means to &ldquo;insure&rdquo;. There are a few  events which can impact our accumulation for retirement or financial  independence. </p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Medical bills:</strong> In the case where we have insufficient  savings to cover for our own medical bills, we would be loaded with a mountain  of medical bills if we fall ill.</li>
  <li><strong>Loss of income due to medical crisis or death:</strong> Another risk of not having sufficient insurance coverage is that we are not able to  provide for our dependents due to our loss of income (Eg. Spouse, children and  parents) in our unfortunate death or disability.</li>
</ol>
<p>The state of the insurance industry is that financial planners are mostly remunerated by commissions based on product sales. The amount of premiums we pay may not necessarily translate to the amount of  insurance coverage we are covered for and need. The truth is that it is easy  and possible for us to be adequately insured at a reasonable cost if we  purchase the right insurance products. </p>

<p>It is possible for one aged 35 years old with average  income and moderate needs to be adequately insured for S$200+ a month. </p>
<br>
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Have you done the above must-dos?</strong></h3>

<p>If you have not, please do so now<a name="_GoBack"></a>. We do not want to risk having our hard-earned savings and  investment gains wiped out due to <strong>our </strong>own  greed and carelessness by not prioritising. We have to protect our existing  assets and plan ahead for any unexpected events first. The journey before  investing could take years and it is important to be patient before diving into  the markets. </p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s encourage one another to clear our  debts, build our emergency savings, plan for our important expenses and insure ourselves adequately now. We are not only doing ourselves a favour but a very  important favour for our loved ones as well.</p>
