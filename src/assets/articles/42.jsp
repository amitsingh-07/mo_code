<p>At DIYInsurance, we have always advocated Term Insurance as the best way to provide for sufficient insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Recently, we had a few industry practitioners attacking the use of term insurance on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/diyinsurance.com.sg" target="_blank">facebook page</a>. </p>
<p>To share our thoughts in detail and elaborate on our insurance philosophy, we have written an e-book, <a href="../download/ebook/term-vs-life" target="_blank">The Case of Term vs Whole Life Insurance: A Comprehensive Consumer Guide</a>. We hope that this e-book would be able to help you have a better understanding of how you can plan for their own insurance needs.
<p>We have put together the following infographic to cover the contents of the e-book succinctly. However, we really recommend that you will be able to read the entire e-book which provides more details.  You may <a href="../download/ebook/term-vs-life" target="_blank">click here</a> to download the e-book free for a limited time.
