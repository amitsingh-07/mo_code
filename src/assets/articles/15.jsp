<p>When it comes to insurance, most  people are familiar with the standard benefits like <a href="https://www.moneyowl.com.sg/#/direct" target="_blank" title="Compare Protection Plans Now">death</a>, critical illnesses  (e.g. cancer, heart attack) and hospitalisation. Yes, these are indeed important  life risks that we ought to insure against. The financial impact can be  disastrous if we die too early, not leaving enough for dependants&rsquo; living  expenses or be saddled with huge medical bills from treatment of serious  illnesses. However, most people seem to have missed out one other important  risk factor: disability.<br><br>

If an accident or illness happens,  resulting in our being unable to work, we would have lost one of our biggest  assets - our income earning capacity. <br>
</p><br>
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>How much is the loss</strong></h3>
 
<p>Suppose a young professional, John  Tan, age 30, earning $4,000 per month as an Accountant is now unable to work  because of a car accident. He would have lost $1,680,000 that he could have  earned had he worked till age 65. If we assume a pay rise of 3% every year, the  loss of earnings would be as much as $2,600,000!<br><br>In insurance jargon, it is called  the human capital - your biggest financial asset.<br>
  </p>
  <br>
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>What is Disability Income Insurance</strong></h3>
 
<p>Disability income insurance is the  only insurance that insures against your income earning capacity. For  simplicity in understanding, the following are the benefits of this insurance:</p>
<br>

<ol class="alpha">
	<li>
		<p><strong>If Insured  is unable to perform material duties of own occupation, monthly income will be  payable for the first 2 years.</strong></p>

		<p>Let&rsquo;s assume John (above  example) has bought a Disability Income insurance with a monthly benefit of  $3,000. After the car accident, he is unable to work as expected of an  Accountant. His insurance will pay him a monthly income of $3,000 after a waiting  period of, say 3 months, for the first 2 years.</p>
		
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Subsequently,  the monthly income continues to be payable if insured is still unable to work  in a reasonable occupation by virtue of his/her training, education or  experience.</strong></p>

		<p>After the first 2  years, if John&rsquo;s disability still prevents him from working in any reasonable  occupation, he will continue to receive the $3,000 monthly benefits for up to  age 65. </p>
		<p>Some disability  income policies provide a 3% annual increase in monthly benefits to take care  of inflation. If John&rsquo;s policy has such a benefit, his subsequent year&rsquo;s payout  would be $3,090 per month (year 2), $3,182 per month (year 2), $3,278 per month  (year 3) and so on.</p>
		
	</li>

	<li>
		<p><strong>If  insured is able to return to work but suffers a pay drop, a partial monthly income  benefit is payable to supplement the income.</strong></p>

		<p>3 years on, John is  able to return to work but at a lower capacity and could only earn $2,000 per month.  His insurance will pay him a partial benefit of $1,500 per month (benefit is  computed based on proportional drop in his income before suffering disability).  In total, John&rsquo;s income is now $3,500 ($2,000 + $1,500). The partial income  benefit serves as an incentive for John to return to work as he would receive  more income than not working.<br><br>
            There are other benefits included  in the disability income policy, such as rehabilitation benefit (3-6 months of  income benefit) and  <a href="https://www.moneyowl.com.sg/#/direct" target="_blank" title="Compare Life Protection Plans Now">death benefit</a>.<br>
  		</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<br>
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Why this insurance often is overlooked</strong></h3>
 
<p>Disability income policy has been  around for more a decade but consumer awareness is still low. The reasons I  observe are as follows:</p>
<br>

<ul class="bluedot">
	<li>
		<p><strong>Not easy  for insurance advisors to explain to consumers. </strong></p>
        <p>Indeed Disability Income  policies are more complex than the  <a href="https://www.moneyowl.com.sg/#/direct" target="_blank" title="Compare Protection Plans Now">standard death and critical illness policies</a>. It is not easy to explain, in definite terms, to what extent the  disability must be before the income benefit continues to be payable after 2  years (see point b). </p>
		<p>What is meant by a  reasonable occupation by virtue of &lsquo;training, education or experience?&rsquo; It is  too general and subjective to accept. In assessing claims, insurance companies rely  on their in-house objective judgement together with medical and other  professionals&rsquo; opinions. </p>
		<p>Unfortunately, that  is the nature of such insurance. Important but difficult to explain. As such,  many advisors may prefer to avoid this insurance and go for those easier to  market.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Consumers  are confused.</strong></p>
		<p>Most people  associate disability income insurance with Total and Permanent Disability  (TPD). It is not. TPD benefit is found in most Whole Life and Term policies and  the cost of such benefit is quite cheap. However, TPD has very stringent claim  criteria. It requires one to lose any 2 of 6 limbs; namely eyes, hands (above  wrist) and legs (above ankle) - or unable to perform 3 out of 6 Activities of  Daily Living (feeding, dressing, toileting, washing, mobility and  transferring).</p>
		<p>Disability Income  insurance, however, has a more lenient form of disability definition. It is  based on one&rsquo;s occupation and easier to qualify than TPD.</p>
		
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>Only 3  companies are offering it. </strong></p>
		<p>GE and Aviva are  the pioneers with AIA joining the list in recent years. Why are there so few  providers? Firstly, the forces of demand and supply. The market size for  disability income is not big enough for many insurers to be excited about. </p>
		<p>Secondly, the risk  to insurer is quite high. Consider our example John. If he is disabled for 30  years, the insurer has to pay up to $1,080,000 ($3,000 pm x 12 mth x 30 years).  Yet, the premium for his Disability Income insurance policy only costs around  $574 pa.</p>
	
	</li>
</ul>
  
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>  If earning an  income is very important to you and your dependants, you need to insure it.  Disability Income insurance is the only policy that is able to do that.</p>
