<p><em>This  article is part of <strong>The Case of Term vs  Whole Life Insurance: A Comprehensive Consumer Guide</strong> e-book. The following  chapters will be released shortly.</em></p>

<h2 class="primary-color"><strong>Prologue</strong></h2>
<p>It all started one evening on 16 June 2016, with a Facebook post on our DIYInsurance page by Marq Siew. He read an article (Term vs Whole  Life) that we posted and disagreed with what we have said.</p>
<p>The following is the actual Facebook exchanges between us  that spanned a few days. A few other financial adviser/insurance advisers  subsequently joined in, sharing similar sentiments.</p>

      <p><i class="fa fa-1x fa-quote-left primary-color" aria-hidden="true"></i> Why  is DIYinsurance <strong>product-oriented instead of customer-oriented?</strong> Why not  focus on how to get the <strong>most appropriate protection instrument-type for the  particular person?</strong><br>
	  <br>
	  Why is there a need to have an obsession with <strong>arguing about which instrument  is better than the other?</strong><br>
	  <br>
	  Is DIYinsurance advocating a <strong>one-size-fits-all approach?</strong> Or a  one-type-fits-all approach?<br>
	  <br>
	  If there is a minimal understanding of insurance, <strong>one would know that all  types of policies are created and designed with a different reason</strong> and  purpose: to be suitable for different people.<br>
	  <br>
	  If there is a <strong>basic understanding of how market forces work, DIYinsurance  should know that if there is really only 1 type of protection instrument that  makes sense, how long will it take for the public to find out? Why is there not  a massive landslide of market share to only that instrument even after 50 years?

	  The analogy that was given in this video is not similar but close to telling us  why we should always rent a home (no cash value) and never buy a home (with  cash value).<br>

	  There is <strong>no best financial instrument. Only  the Most Suitable</strong>. Just like your spouse. (If not everyone will only insist  on marrying Fan Bingbing.) </p>

    <p><i class="fa fa-1x fa-quote-left primary-color" aria-hidden="true"></i> Dear Marq Siew, thank you for watching this space and your comment.  You are indeed right to say that we should not be product-oriented but  customer-oriented. It is precisely because of this that we have since 2003,  been educating the consumers on why using <a href="https://www.diyinsurance.com.sg/portal/articles/html?title=Why+Most+Needs+can+be+Covered+by+Term+Insurance?&art_id=59" target="_blank" title="Why Most Needs can be covered by Term Insurance">Term insurances</a> might be a better  option. It is well known in the industry that selling <a href="https://www.diyinsurance.com.sg/portal/articles/html?title=Here%27s+the+True+Purpose+of+Using+Term+and+Whole+Life+Insurance&art_id=55" target="_blank" title="Purpose of using Term and Whole Life Insurance">Whole Life plans</a> pay better. We would be self-serving if we have advocated it but instead, we chose to advocate  a lower cost but better suited product to consumers. This is our way of putting  our clients' interest, always first.<br>
	<br>
	We are passionate about doing this, not because we believe in a one-size fit all solution. We do so because if you understand the use of insurance in one's  financial plan, you will see that this is a fundamental issue: Insurance is for  protection and not investment for returns. And for the large majority, and <strong>we  emphasise large majority</strong>, this need for replacement of income due to death  is a temporary need. There will come a time when there is no longer a need  because we are no longer earning an income. Also, using Term insurance is the  only way to be fully covered. For the minority that may need Whole Life, and  really there aren't many in our almost 2 decades of experience, when they pass through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/diyinsurance.com.sg/?hc_location=ufi">Diyinsurance.com.sg</a>, we will certainly advise them  accordingly.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	You are also right to point out that <strong>after 50 years, most people in  Singapore continues to buy Whole Life Plans</strong>. This is because in the earlier  days, we do not have many well-designed Term Insurances available and also the  lack of financial literacy education. This is why we are doing this since 2003.  We are gratified that more and more consumers and insurance agents are  understanding this and buying Term Insurances. We have also known of many  insurance advisers selling Term despite earning them a lower commission. This tis  indeed laudable. You may also be encouraged to know that in more developed  financial markets such as Australia, US and UK, the use of Whole Life Plans are  almost non-existent. We are far way from being there but we hope&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/diyinsurance.com.sg/?hc_location=ufi">Diyinsurance.com.sg</a>&nbsp;will be able to  play a small part to help us reach there one day.<br>
	<br>
	Unfortunately, we feel  that the use of renting versus buying a house is not an apt analogy here to  compare Term to Whole Life Plans. Due to the lack of space, we will leave that  conversation to another day.<br>
	<br>
	But Marq Siew, thank you  for your interest and comment. We appreciate it because such friendly debate  provides consumers with more understanding. I am sure we all just want to do  the right thing for the consumers. </p>

  	<p><i class="fa fa-1x fa-quote-left primary-color" aria-hidden="true"></i> Thank you  DIYinsurance. I am glad we share the same philosophy of providing tailored and  customized solutions for each unique individual.<br>
		  <br>
	  I would like to finally and immediately, put a Full-Stop to a well heard rumor: <strong>that it is well known in the industry that recommending Term Policies gives  financial planners Lower commissions</strong>, and thus financial  planners/consultants/advisers don't recommend them.<strong>This is supposed to be  the distinguishing difference for DIYinsurance, because DIYinsurance champions  Term insurance.<br>
	  </strong><br>
	  <strong>For transparency and comparison, let's reveal this once and for all since  DIYinsurance is adamant that Term polices definitely give Lower commision  rates.</strong><br>
	  <br>
	  I hereby request for an Evidence of a commission rate table of Term and Whole  Life products:&nbsp;<br>
	  <br>
	  (I) to prove that the commision rates from pure Term instruments are lower, and  for apple-to-apple comparisons, use both products of same coverage tenure till  age of 99 or 100.<br>
	  <br>
	  (II) the commission % you show in (I) should be the exact % which Insurance  Manufacturers (such as Tokiomarine, AXA, AVIVA) give DIYinsurance via the  Distribution Agreements your IFA have signed with them.<br>
	  <br>
	  (III) I would like to ensure for fairness sake of the whole Singapore market,  that as an IFA, although DIYinsurance likely may not have the right to sell for  certain companies, please also provide in the same table of point (I), PRU, AIA  and GE commission rates for Term and Whole Life policies as well. Same method,  for apple-to-apple comparisons, use both products of same coverage duration  till age of 99 or 100.<br>
	  <br>
	  Let's allow the whole world to see which Insurance company/manufacturer is so  bold as to give lower Commissions for recommending Term coverage/policies.<br>
	  <br>
	  The blame should go to the particular  insurance company, instead of going after the anonymous financial consultants  whom DIYinsurance often speak about. </p>

	<p><i class="fa fa-1x fa-quote-left primary-color" aria-hidden="true"></i> By  the way, regulators have indicated before that they do not wish to see  product-type pushing (Term policies are a product-type), by expressing that  Incentives should not be given for any particular product-type.<br>
	<br>
	  One might argue that Term cover need&nbsp;not be until the age of 99 or 100,  but since it is impossible to structure a Whole Life instrument into a shorter  number of years, but there is the existence of Term policies which can cover  until the age of 99 and 100, let's use that as an apple-to-apple  comparison.&nbsp;<br>
	  <br>
	  If anyone wants to insist that Every human being requires protection cover only  until an exact certain age, that is a broadstroke technique, which shows zero  understanding of providing customized tailoring for each unique individual.<br>
	  <br>
	  <strong>One might also say that it is sensitive to publish commision rates, or that  the insurance companies/manufacturers do not allow you to do so.</strong><br>
		  <br>
	  If that it the case, I would request  DIYinsurance to stop publishing articles which insinuates that Singapore  financial planners/consultants/advisers get <strong>Lower commission rates for  recommending Term policies, and make a public apology, because that is an  accusation by DIYinsurance, which has not been backed by DIYinsurance's  disclosure of factual figures to the public.</strong> </p>

	  I'm waiting for the evidence to be provided, to see if the Comm rate is the  same for Term and Whole Life policies. If the Comm rate happens to be the same,  then whether the nominal commision is lower, will actually depend on the size  of&nbsp;the Term policy, and the blame should not be on the instrument type.<br>
	  <br>
	  Nobody can guarantee that a larger Term policy with no cash value will  definitely have lower Commissions, compared to a smaller instrument with cash  value.&nbsp;<br>
	  <br>
	  Why demonize the cash value of a policy when the actual issue is about customization  and tailoring?<br>
	  <br>
	  A needs-based approach is based on a full understanding of the unique  individual, not based on the glorification /worship of a particular  product-type.&nbsp;<br>
	  <br>
	  <strong>Is it even correct to assume that all Singaporeans do Not require coverage  after exactly 65 years old? That is what I read from another DIYinsurance  article, &quot;Singapore's Term Life Insurance Comparison Table (June  2016)&quot;.</strong><br>
	  <br>
	  <strong>On what basis can anyone insinuate/suggest that when a financial adviser did  not recommend a Term policy, it is definitely because of lower Commissions and  not because of a need-based and priority-based recommendation?&nbsp;</strong><br>
	  <br>
	  It is as audacious as suggesting that every adviser who recommends a CPF  Investment instrument, is preparing to commit Churning.<br>
	  <br>
	  Advocating the appropriate Term cover for  suitable people is a noble act, but not by insinuating that all other  recommendations are wrong. </p>

<br>
<p><strong>Just  in case you do not have the time to read the detail, this is in summary Marq&rsquo;s  points of contention:</strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>That in advocating <a href="/articles/entry/59" target="_blank" title="Why Most Needs can be covered by Term Insurance">Term insurance</a>, we are not being customer-oriented but product-oriented</li>
    <li>That we are obsessed with arguing which instrument is better. He feels that all products are created to meet a certain need. If DIYInsurance advocates the use of Term insurance against <a href="/articles/entry/55" target="_blank" title="Purpose of using Term and Whole Life Insurance">Whole Life plans</a>, we are advocating a one-size fits all approach. We should instead customise each plan to customers&rsquo; needs</li>
  <li>That regulators have indicated before that they do not wish to see product-type pushing (Term policies are a product-type), by expressing that incentives should not be given for any particular product-type. As such, by advocating Term&nbsp;insurance, What DIYInsurance is doing is akin to product pushing. </li>
  <li>That If Term insurance is so good, like what DIYInsurance is saying, there should be a massive landslide of market share to Term plans. But this is currently not the case.&nbsp;Marq is alluding that good products will lead to huge market share or simply put, a huge market share means that the product must be good.</li>
  <li>That Providend/DIYInsurance is saying that Term insurance commission rates are lower than Whole Life commission rate. And as such, we should publish a table on commission rates to the public.</li>
  <li>That DIYInsurance is insinuating Singapore financial planners/consultants/advisers because we allude to them getting lower commission rates for recommending Term policies and so most prefer to recommend Whole Life plans. </li>
  <li>That DIYInsurance should make a public apology for point 6. </li>
  <li>That we assumed that all Singaporeans do not require coverage after exactly aged 65 years old.</li>
</ol>
<p>We want to thank Marq (and many other insurance &amp;  financial advisers) for following us at DIYInsurance and sharing their thoughts  on how they view insurance as advisers. Through these discussions, we realise  that after more than a decade of writing about insurance, there are still many  misconceptions that need to be clarified.</p>
<p>So, instead of answering Marq&rsquo;s questions/pointers one by  one, what we will do is to first provide a thorough understanding on this  subject of insurance. By doing so, we achieve the following objectives:</p>
 <ol type="a">
 	<li>Provide a context, and a basis for answering Marq&rsquo;s  questions/pointers</li>
    <li>Give a better understanding to other advisers on our  professional views about insurance</li>
    <li>Consumers through this book will also be able to  discuss more systematically and clearly with their advisers, before making  their insurance decisions going forward.</li>
</ol>

<p>But since insurance is a very wide topic, to cover every  area and type of insurance in one book will not only be too much but also make  this book unreadable. And since this book is really about the Term vs Whole  Life debate we will limit our discussion to:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li><strong>Insurance that replaces your income loss due to death, total and permanent disability and dread disease (critical illness)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Insurance that provides money for alternative medicine and care</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>At DIYInsurance, we believe in empowering our clients to  make wise financial decisions. We are thankful that we have a chance to do this  via this platform. &nbsp;In many ways, all of us have Mr Marq Siew to thank for  the birth of this book. Without him sharing his views on insurance, the idea of  this book would never have materialised.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-muted"><em>Note: In the course of writing this book, more Facebook  posts from Mr. Siew and others (many who are advisers) flooded in. We have shared these posts in appendix 6 of this book.</em></p>
<br><br>
<h2 class="primary-color"><strong>Chapter 1 - Insurance  Philosophy</strong></h2><br>
<p>Whether in investment or insurance planning, there is great  importance to establish a philosophy. The purpose of the philosophy is to set  forth&nbsp;a belief, a conviction, a doctrine, a theory behind the practice.  The philosophy becomes a basis where all planning and execution start. It also  ensures consistency in a professional service firm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, philosophies are not cast in stones. But by large,  they hold true for most scenarios. Outliers are always there, but they should  be taken care of separately, after being sure that they are really, outliers.  And we will not know, unless we have already a philosophy that we can anchor  on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the saying goes, &quot;if you stand for nothing, you will  fall for anything.&quot; The philosophy and in this case, insurance philosophy,  is where we can stand upon when we plan our insurance needs.</p>
<br><br>
<img src="assets/articles/images/37/family.jpg" class="pull-right" style=" padding:10px;" alt="Family with Kids Playing with Coin">
<h3 class="primary-color">Providend  and DIYInsurance's Insurance Philosophy</h3><br>
<p>The primary purpose of insurance is for protection and not  savings and investments. For if we want to save and invest, there are plenty of  options (see below for the many options available to investors). There is no  need to use insurance. Insurance (less annuities) is not the best instrument  for savings and investments. This is because, for the low returns, the lack of liquidity  and flexibility just do not justify it.</p>
<p>And if insurance is primarily for protection, we should buy  as much as we need but spend as little as we can on it. This is because,  insurance is a risk management tool. We really don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;use&rdquo; it. As such,  we should minimise this expense so that the cost (premiums) vs benefits  (coverage, sum assured) is reasonable and justifiable. In minimising expenses  spent on a risk management tool, we also free up financial resources to achieve  our other life goals, such as accumulating for retirement, funding children&rsquo;s  tertiary education and also, live an enjoyable life now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In executing this philosophy, we make the following  reasonable assumptions:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>If we are financially savvy, we may make financial and investment decisions without an adviser</li>
  <li>If we are not financially savvy, or we don&rsquo;t have time, we should work with a trusted adviser</li>
  <li>We have limited financial resources but unlimited wants &amp; many needs</li>
</ol>
<p>But before we go and talk about protection, let&rsquo;s look at  some of the possible savings and investment options for investors.&nbsp;</p>
<br>

<br><br>
<p>So once again, as we can see from the table above, there are  so many options to save and invest. There is really no need and may not be  advantageous to use insurance for saving and investing.</p>
<br><h3 class="primary-color">The Three Key Questions To Ask Before Buying Our Insurance</h3><br>
<p>So if insurance is primarily for protection, what do we need  to do to ensure that we are adequately covered at the minimum cost? To be able  to do that, we need to answer three fundamental questions</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>How long do we need insurance cover?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>How much coverage do we need?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Which type of insurance is suitable, after answering question 1 and 2.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We will answer these questions over the next few chapters.</p>
