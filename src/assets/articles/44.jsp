<p>It is the time of the year when the focus is on the <a href="http://www.mof.gov.sg/MOF-For/Individuals/Supplementary-Retirement-Scheme-SRS" target="_blank" title="Supplementary Retirement Scheme">Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS)</a> again as the deadline for contributing to the SRS draws closer. </p>
<br/>
<p>Despite  the benefits that come with the Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS), it is often  overlooked as some find it difficult to understand how the scheme works.</p>
<br/>
<p>In a snapshot, the SRS is a voluntary scheme to encourage  us to save for retirement, over and above our CPF savings. Each dollar of SRS  contribution will reduce our income chargeable to tax by a dollar in the next  Year of Assessment (YA). In addition, only 50%  of the withdrawals from SRS are taxable after retirement age and investment gains  in SRS accumulate tax-free before withdrawal. </p>
<br>
<h2 class="primary-color"><strong>How can we benefit from SRS? </strong></h2>
<p>We illustrate using an example.</p>
<br>

<br><br>
<h5><strong><u>Enjoy Tax Savings</u></strong></h5><br>
Assuming you have a taxable income of $72,000 before  tax-relief from SRS, <br>
Tax payable on $72,000 = $550 (on first $40,000)* + $2240  (7% X $32,000)* <br>
= <strong>$2,790</strong>
<br><br><p>If you contribute $15,300 in <a href="http://www.mof.gov.sg/MOF-For/Individuals/Supplementary-Retirement-Scheme-SRS" target="_blank" title="Supplementary Retirement Scheme">SRS</a> by 31st  December 2018, you can claim $15,300 of tax relief in the Year of Assessment  (YA) 2019. <br>
  Your taxable income would be= $72,000 - $15,300 (tax relief  enjoyed) = $56,700<br>
  Tax payable on $56,700 =<strong> </strong>$550 (on first $40,000)* + $1169 (7% X $16,700)*<br>
	= <strong>$1,719</strong></p>
<br/>
<p><strong>Your tax savings  with SRS</strong> = $2790-$1719<strong> = $1,071</strong></p>
<br/>
<p>To calculate how much tax savings you enjoy by contributing  to SRS, <a href="https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/investments/supplementary-retirement-scheme.html#calculator" target="_blank">use this useful calculator  by OCBC here.</a></p>
	<p class="text-muted"><small><strong>*</strong>Based on  IRAS&rsquo; <a href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Income-Tax-Rates/" target="_blank">current  income tax rates and brackets</a></small>
<small>**Please note that from the Year of Assessment 2018 (when income earned in 2017 is assessed to tax), there is a personal income tax relief cap of $80,000.</small>
</p>
<br>
  <p>At retirement age, you can spread withdrawals from SRS for up to 10 years.<strong></strong><br>
  If you have saved $400,000 in SRS at age 62, you can  withdraw $40,000 each year over 10 years. Since 50% of withdrawals are not  taxable with SRS, only $20,000 (50% x $40,000) is taxable. </p>
	<br/>
	<p> <a href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Individuals/Locals/Working-Out-Your-Taxes/Income-Tax-Rates/" target="_blank">Based on current  tax rates</a>, the first $20,000 is not taxable and hence you do not  have to pay any taxes if you have no additional income. </p>
