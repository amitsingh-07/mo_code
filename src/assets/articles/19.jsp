<p>It  strikes me hard that for majority people of the people whom I know, they are  paying a significant amount from their hard-earned income for their insurance  but yet, are still severely underinsured.</p><br>
<p>For  a young couple, it is not unthinkable that they may need $1million of life  insurance cover each. This is to provide for their family&rsquo;s living expenses and  children&rsquo;s education and repayment of outstanding loans if an unexpected event  of death occurs. While this figure seems like an enormous amount of coverage to  pay for, it need not cost a bomb.</p>

  For  us to be covered by life insurance for our entire life, it is very expensive  with <a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-financial-products/insurance/types-of-insurance/life-insurance/types-of-life-insurance/whole-life-insurance.aspx" target="_blank" title="Whole Life Insurance">whole life insurance</a>. We will find that we are not able to sufficiently  insure ourselves if we use whole life insurance. For a 30 year-old male,  $500,000 whole life coverage could cost <strong>S$7,000  annually*</strong> to be paid annually for 49 years! <br>
  Are  you overpaying for the amount of insurance coverage you have? Are you  sufficiently insured for your loved ones?<br><br>
  Purchasing  a term insurance is the only way to provide for sufficient coverage. To understand  about the Case of Term Life Insurance: <a href="/assets/articles/document/the-case-for-term-insurance-7-nov-2010.pdf" target="_blank">Read here</a></p>
<br><h3 class="primary-color"><strong>The Purpose of  Insurance </strong></h3>
<img src="/assets/articles/images/19/umbrella_coins.jpg" class="pull-right" style=" padding:10px;" alt="Umbrella with coins image">
<p><strong> </strong>
  The  purpose of insurance is to transfer our risk of a loss to another party in  exchange for money. It is important that we adequately transfer our risk  (sufficiently insure ourselves) and to keep the cost that we are paying for  insurance low. However, there are many misconceptions when it comes to  insurance and these are the common ones which I have come across: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>I need life insurance coverage for my whole  life:</strong> Our financial obligations tend to decrease  as we age due to the fact that, as our dependents grow older, they are  dependent on us for a fewer number of years. We should have also built up  sufficient assets such that if an unexpected event were to occur, we would have  sufficient assets to leave behind for our dependents to live on. There comes a  point of time in our life when we do not need any life insurance coverage to  provide for our loved ones as they are no longer dependent on us  financially.Â  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Whole life insurance is always better because  I may only have to pay for a limited number of years and I can save as well</strong>: For insurance companies to craft a policy where it is possible for one  to pay only for a limited number of years, it means that a lot more has to be  paid for the initial years to compensate for the other remaining years. If we  are using <a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-financial-products/insurance/types-of-insurance/life-insurance/types-of-life-insurance/whole-life-insurance.aspx" target="_blank" title="Whole Life Insurance">whole life insurance</a> for savings, for the low liquidity and returns  it provides, we could use many other investment tools which allow us the  flexibility to draw our money when we need to without any penalties and  possibly achieve greater returns with them. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>More coverage is always better:</strong> This only holds true if we do not have other financial commitments.  Accumulating enough funds to <a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/life-events/retirement.aspx" target="_blank" title="retirement">retire</a> is not easy to achieve. In a study done by  AIA in 2014, 55% of Singaporean respondents were worried they would not be able  to save enough as compared to a regional average of 44%. More worryingly, 35%  of Singaporean respondents ranked saving for retirement as the most difficult  goal to achieve in life. If we decide to spend more on insurance, something  else has to be forgone. This could mean prolonging our working years and  pushing back our retirement age.</li>
</ul>
<p>I  hope that more of us will understand and spread the word of the purpose of  insurance and the importance of insuring ourselves sufficiently. We do not have  to overpay when we purchase the right type of insurance and it does not cost us  an arm and a leg for us to be adequately insured for our loved ones.</p>
