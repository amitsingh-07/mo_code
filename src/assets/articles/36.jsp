<p>In November 2004, when I wrote in this column  on why one should use term insurances instead of <a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-financial-products/insurance/types-of-insurance/life-insurance/types-of-life-insurance/whole-life-insurance.aspx" target="_blank" title="Whole Life Plans">whole life plans</a>, I never  expected it to create such a great interest. Over the last 2 months, I received  letters, emails, forum threads and phone calls expressing their opinions. Many  advisers also wrote articles on the same topic to express their views. While  some financial advisers wished <a href="https://www.providend.com/" target="_blank" title="Providend">Providend</a> would somehow disappear from the face  of this earth for rocking the boat, many clients, members of the public (from  as far as US) and people from the financial fraternity expressed their  appreciation of our opinions. And since we were the ones who started the topic,  I thought it would only be appropriate for us to clarify some misconceptions,  which have surfaced as a result of our article.</p>
  <br clear="all">

  <h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Limited resources, unlimited needs</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
  <p>All of us have plenty of financial needs. Insurance for protection,  investments for our retirement &amp; kid&rsquo;s education, paying our mortgages, car  loans and so on. But our resources are limited. If you are a male aged 35 and  need to provide your family with a monthly income of $3,000 for 20 years in  the event of your unfortunate demise, you will need about 600,000 cover. If you intend to retire at age 55, Table 1 shows the  comparison for the various types of plans.</p>
  <p>The truth is, how many  can afford paying more than $6,000 or $10,000 per year, just to cover his individual death needs? In the  above example, we haven&rsquo;t even considered his medical, his spouse, and his  children insurance needs yet. We can discuss all the merits of whole life with  cash values and so on, but if we cannot even fully cover our needs, what&rsquo;s the point? </p>

  	<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>About temporary and permanent needs</strong></h3>
    <p>&ldquo;But term plans are temporary. It will cease after a certain period.  So when you need insurance most, you don&rsquo;t have it&rdquo; So say the proponents of  <a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-financial-products/insurance/types-of-insurance/life-insurance/types-of-life-insurance/whole-life-insurance.aspx" target="_blank" title="Whole Life Plans">whole life plans</a>. Let&rsquo;s look at some of the common protection needs and whether  they are permanent or temporary (Table 2):</p>

  	<blockquote class="blockquote blockquote-reverse">
	  <p class="m-b-0"><strong>When one buys a non-par plan, is he buying it to protect a  permanent need or temporary need?</strong></p>
	</blockquote>	
  	<br>
  	<br clear="all">
  	<p>From table 2, it becomes clear that most of our  protection needs are temporary, with the exception of providing for  hospitalisation costs and maybe say, alternative medicine. Insuring against  high hospitalisation cost can be done effectively using a good  hospitalisation &amp; surgical plan that pays the first dollar that you  incur. To provide for the need of  alternative medicine in the event of a critical illness, you can buy a small  term plan that covers critical illness till age 90 or 99.</p>

  	<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>About level premiums</strong></h3>
	<p>In the letters to the BT from directors of 2 financial advisory  companies after our article on term insurance were published, It was  interesting to note that the both their understanding of premiums with regard  to whole life and term plans contradict each  other.</p>

<p>One said that when you buy <a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-financial-products/insurance/types-of-insurance/life-insurance/types-of-life-insurance/whole-life-insurance.aspx" target="_blank" title="Whole Life Plans">whole life plans</a>, there is this need for  cash values because it acts as &lsquo;excess&rsquo; premium required to keep the premium  constant during the lifetime of the insured. The other however said that for  term policies (though there are no cash values), it is also possible to keep  premiums constant as there is pre-funding where the &ldquo;excess&rdquo; premiums are  invested so that this reserve can be used to fund higher premiums in later  years. Let me help clarify that it is not important to know how the insurance  companies keep their premiums level, but rather for readers, it is enough to  know that whether whole life (par or non-par) or term policies, premiums are  kept constant during the period of cover.</p>
 <br clear="all">
    
    <h3 class="primary-color"><strong>About Whole-life (non-par) plans</strong></h3>
<p>Whole life (non-par) plans, like term plans are insurance that gives  you a fixed cover of say, $600,000 (without  bonus) for your period of cover. However, if you surrender the policy at  certain point in time, you get back your premiums plus certain guaranteed  returns. Of course, nothing is for free; the premiums are a lot higher than term plans (see table 1). <strong>Although it is tempting to get something  back if we surrender a policy, buying it for this purpose commit 2 fundamental  errors that we have discussed:</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>You may  never be able to cover your whole family with that kind of premiums. Even if  you can, you leave very little for your other financial needs.</li>
    <li>If most of your needs are temporary, why  commit to a whole life?</li>
  </ol>
<p>There is also something ironic about non-par plans. When one buys such a plan, is he buying it to protect a permanent need or temporary  need? If he has been convinced that he has a permanent need, and will not  surrender the plan, when he makes a claim, he loses all cash values and only  get the fixed cover. So he pays more but gets the same benefits as term plans.  However, if his needs are temporary and he intends to surrender it at some  point in time, why did he pay so much for a whole life plan in the first place,  when he can get the same cover at lower cost by using a term plan? The very reason why you bought an insurance  plan becomes the reason that disadvantages you. Ironic? I think so too.</p>


  <br clear="all">

<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>About insurance being a low risk instrument for investing</strong></h3>
<p>Most insurance companies use 5.25% as the projected  returns; it is also stated in the benefit illustration of <a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-financial-products/insurance/types-of-insurance/life-insurance/types-of-life-insurance/whole-life-insurance.aspx" target="_blank" title="Whole Life Plans">whole life plans</a> that  the projected yield could be 6.75%. As such, insurance companies may take a much higher risk to achieve the returns for  policyholders. However, after deducting for distribution cost, the actual  return, depending on when you surrender the policy, can be as low as 1% p.a or an average of 3-4% p.a. The low return may give the  perception that it is a low risk vehicle where in fact it is caused by the cost  of distribution.</p>

<p>In the past, portions  of the cash values come with a certain guarantee, as it is regulatory  requirements to do so. However, with the ushering in of the new risk-based  capital regime, this requirement has been cancelled. What this means is that we  may increasingly see traditional plans with no guaranteed cash values, which  will put it in equal footing with all investment instruments. People should  know that the advantage of insurance lies not in the returns but in the  protection it gives for a relatively small premium. It is encouraging to see  that the insurance companies that <a href="https://www.providend.com/" target="_blank" title="Providend">Providend</a> represents are continuously  developing excellent term plans for our clients. Companies such as Asia Life, HSBC, NTUC &amp; UOB have excellent  term life. AXA, Manulife have  got one of the best hospitalisation plans in Singapore. This  signals their belief in being an institution that truly want to care for the  protection needs of their policyholders.</p>
  <p>The last 2 months have not been easy for us as we sing a different  tune and receive all sorts of unkind comments. But as long as readers gets the  financial education that is so badly needed, and as long as we can help you  consider these issues before you buy your next insurance, we will continue to  toil on.</p>
