<p>Hello, do you know that you can save on the  cost you pay for insurance?</p>
<p>  With DIYInsurance, we help you to save by  rebating to you 50% in commissions!</p>
<p>  How does this work? Let&rsquo;s begin by  explaining commissions.</p>
<p>  When you buy an insurance policy, you pay  premiums to the insurance company. A part of your premiums is used to pay the  salesperson or better known as a commission which the salesperson receives.  Depending on the type of policy, the length of commissions&rsquo; payout is usually 3  to 6 years long.</p>
<p>  When you buy through DIYInsurance, you  eliminate the need for a salesperson to solicit business. This allows us to  lower our costs and rebate 50% in commissions back to you. You could receive  commission rebates for up to 6 years. </p>
