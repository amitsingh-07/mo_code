<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Do  you look forward to a claim when you buy insurance?</strong></h3>
<p>  Whenever  I travel, I would cover myself with travel insurance. Just because I am covered  with travel insurance, do I actually hope to lose my baggage, miss my flight  connection, fall ill or meet with an accident? I definitely do not. I still  remember my fateful experience of losing my wallet while I was holidaying in  Hawaii. Was it an anti-climax to the holiday? I was certaintly thankful that I recovered some loss through an insurance claim. </p>
<p>  Life insurance serves as a way to compensate  for a loss. If the item we lose is an object like a luggage or house, it can be  easily quantified into dollar terms. But what if death occurs, how do you quantify  the loss of your life? How much life insurance do you and your family really  need?</p>
<h3 class="primary-color"><br><strong>Simple rule-of-thumb</strong></h3>
<p>  In the past, financial advisers used a  simple method to estimate death needs. It is quick and easy:<br><br>
  Multiply your annual income with a  factor ranging from 10 to 15. <br><br>
  <div class="white-box"><u>Example:</u> If you earn $40,000 a year and  a factor of 10 is used, you probably need around $400,000 of death benefits.  ($40,000 x 10 = $400,000)</div><br><br>
  But this is too simplistic to determine  your needs isn&rsquo;t it? It does not consider critical considerations such as your dependants&rsquo; (eg. your spouse, children, your parents) living expenses, future  obligations and your current financial resources when you are no longer around  to provide for them. A more comprehensive approach is preferred now.</p><br>
<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Life Insurance Computation</strong></h3>
<p>  Finding out how much death benefit you  require is simple. You just need to determine two things - your financial obligation to your dependants and your available resources now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
  <li>
      <h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Your Financial Obligation</strong></h3>
      <p>What are your financial obligations if  death occurs now? Consider these areas in determining your financial obligations.</p>
      <br>
      <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li>
              <p><strong>a) How  much do your dependants need for their living expenses?</strong></p>
              <p>If you have no dependants who depend on  your income, e.g. single with wealthy parents, then there is no need for you to  provide for this area. But if you have dependents, you would need to estimate  how much monthly allowance you have to provide for them and for how long.</p>
              <div class="white-box"><p><em><u>Example</u></em><br>
              You are currently contributing $2,000  monthly to your family&rsquo;s expenses and you estimate that you will continue  contributing for another 25 years, until your children start working, or the  life expectancy of your parents.</p>
              <p style="text-align: center">You need = $2,000/month x 12 months x  25 years = <strong>$600,000 life insurance sum  assured</strong></p>
              </div>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
              <p><strong>b) Do  you need to provide for your child&rsquo;s university education?</strong></p>
              <p>The cost of <a href="https://www.moneyowl.com.sg/articles/entry/56" target="_blank" title="Forward Planning for your Child&rsquo;s Education">university education</a> is expensive. How much you need depends on the number of children you are supporting and their  field of study (medicine or non-medicine course). </p>

              </div>
              <div class="white-box"><p><u>Example</u><br>
              You want to provide university  education for 2 kids, one for medicine and the other for non-medicine course.</p>
              <p>You need = $88,400 + $177,000 = <strong>$265,400 life insurance sum assured</strong></p></div>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
              <p><strong>c) Any  loans to pay off</strong></p>
              <p>People generally do not wish to pass on  their debts to their dependants. Consider any outstanding loans you are still  servicing:</p>
              <ul class="bluedot">
                <li>Home  loan</li>
                <li>Car  loan</li>
                <li>Others - eg. personal loan, credit card</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          
          <li>
              <p><strong>d) Any  lump sum gift to beneficiaries</strong></p>
              <p>Some people wish to be able to give a  lump sum to their loved ones (eg. grandparents, nieces/nephews) or even to  charitable organisation (eg. church, SPCA).<br><br>
                Once completed, you just tally up the  above (a + b + c + d) to determine how much death benefits you require.<br></p>
              <div class="white-box"><p><u>Example</u><br>
              <strong>Total Life Insurance Sum required</strong> = $600,000 + $265,400 =<strong> $865,400</strong></p></div>
          </li>
      </ul>

  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
      <h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Your  Available Resources</strong></h3><br>
      <p>After determining your insurance needs,  it is necessary to find out what resources you already have to meet this need.  Essentially, if you need $1,000,000 to provide for your beneficiaries and you  have more resources than that, then you do not need to buy any more life  insurance (death benefits). You only need to purchase if there is a shortfall.<br><br>
      Your available resources can be found  in 2 main sources.</p><br>
      <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li>
            <strong>e) Your  existing insurance coverage</strong>
            <p>How much coverage you have in:</p>
            <ul class="bluedot">
              <li>Your  own policies - eg. <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/Members/Schemes/schemes/other-matters/dependants-protection-scheme" target="_blank" title="DPS Case-Study">Dependant Protection Scheme (DPS)</a>, policies bought from  agents</li>
              <li>Your  company insurance (employee benefits)</li>
            </ul>

          </li>
          
          <li>
              <p><strong>f) Your  current assets</strong></p>
              <p>Usually in the form of:</p>
              <ul class="bluedot">
                <li>Bank  deposits</li>
                <li>Investments - eg. shares, property, unit trusts</li>
                <li>CPF - total of Ordinary, Special and Medisave accounts </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
