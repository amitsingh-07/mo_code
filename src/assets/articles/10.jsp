People who want higher class wards in B1/A or even at private hospitals would have to purchase <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/medishield-life/integrated-shield-plans/about-integrated-shield-plans--ips-.html" target="_blank" title="Integrated Shield Plans">Integrated Shield Plans (IPs)</a> from private insurers, namely, AIA, AXA, Aviva, Great Eastern, NTUC Income and Prudential.</p>
		<p>An Integrated Shield Plan is essentially made up of 2 parts - a basic MediShield, which is managed by the CPF Board and a top-up portion with enhanced benefits managed by the private insurer. </p>
		<p>Operationally, the private insurer acts as the point-of-contact to deal with all communication with the integrated shield plan policyholders from the collection of premium to the settlement of claim. When the premium is collected from the policyholder, the private insurer will then split and pass the portion of premium attributed to MediShield Life to CPF Board. In the event of getting a claim, the private insurer settles the claim with the policyholder and gets reimbursed from CPF Board for the MediShield Life portion of the claim.

		<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Consumers' Dissatisfaction with IPs</strong></h3>

        <p>More than 60% of Singaporeans (data from Ministry of Health) have an <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/medishield-life/integrated-shield-plans/about-integrated-shield-plans--ips-.html" target="_blank" title="Integrated Shield Plans">Integrated Shield Plan</a> since it was introduced in 2008. While IPs are popular, there seems to be an undercurrent of dissatisfaction or confusion that was not brought to awareness until now, says the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/medishield-life/about-medishield-life/what-is-medishield-life.html" target="_blank" title="MediShield Life">MediShield Life</a> Review Committee. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Some  insights from focused group discussions are: </p><br>
		<ol>
		  <li><strong>People Overstretching Themselves To Buy IPs</strong>

              <p>The majority of Singaporeans want  higher coverage than the basic wards in B2/C. This behaviour is understandable  as there are plenty of anecdotal stories that subsidised wards are perpetually  over-crowded, long waiting time and lower quality of care. However, many seem  to have overstretched themselves in getting higher coverage, especially when they  are still young and working since the premiums are quite affordable and can be  paid by <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/schemes/schemes/healthcare/medisave" target="_blank" title="MediSave">Medisave</a>. Some have the intention to downgrade later when premiums  become more expensive at an older age. </p></li>
			<li><strong>Not Fully Utilising Their Entitlement </strong>
		
			<p>The table below shows the types of IPs people have and  the choice of ward they actually stay in during hospitalisation:</p>

			<div class="table-responsive">
				<table class="table table-hover table-condensed table-bordered" >

				    <td valign="top" class="cell-turquoise">

			</div>
			<br>
			<p>More than half of policyholders who have higher  coverage in A ward and private hospitals are actually not making full use of  IPs. They are over insuring themselves resulting in wastage of personal  resources.</p></li>

			
			<li><strong>Poor understanding of IPs </strong>
			
			<p>People have limited knowledge about  the IPs they have signed up for. They may know the wards they are entitled to,  but pay little attention to aspects such as computation of claims, how much  premiums they have to pay and whether their pre-existing medical conditions are  excluded. Hence, dissatisfaction usually arises when they need to file a claim  or when they have to pay more during renewal.</p></li>
			
			  <li><strong>Affordability </strong>
			
			<p>There were 2 major premium hikes for  IPs in 2008 and 2013 with some experiencing a sharp rise by more than 100%. IPs  providers would justify the reason of the hike to be medical inflation,  revision to MediShield and further enhancements added to their IPs. However,  the magnitude of the increase over a short period of time has caused people to  wonder about the sustainability and affordability of IPs.</p></li>
			
			  <li><strong>Exclusion of Pre-existing Conditions</strong>
			
			<p>Some policyholders are not aware that their  pre-existing conditions were excluded in their IPs until they filed for claims.  They were unhappy that such exclusion was not clearly communicated to them.  Others felt that the underwriting for IP is too strict to exclude minor  pre-existing conditions. They wanted insurers to be more flexible and discerning  in underwriting.</p></li>
			
			  <li><strong>Insurer practices create uncertainty among policyholders</strong>

			<p>Insurers&rsquo; practice of revising policy benefits and  premiums, leaving policyholders with little choice over whether to accept,  downgrade or switch insurer (if they are still healthy) causes a lot of  frustration. They hope the government can step in to regulate how these changes  are made.</p></li>

		<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>MediShield Life Review Recommendations  to make IPs work better</strong></h3>
        <p>One significant outcome of the <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/medishield-life/about-medishield-life/what-is-medishield-life.html" target="_blank" title="MediShield Life">MediShield Life</a> Review is the much needed call to review and improve the way IP  is being managed. The main suggestions and recommendations by the Review  Committee are:</p>
		<br>

		<ol>
		  	<li><strong>Government to work with insurers to develop the key  features for a Standard IP meant for B1 ward</strong>
		  	<p>Standardisation of plans will make comparison across  insurers easier to understand. Since benefits are similar, the premiums across  IP insurers should not vary too much.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Premiums for the Standard IP should form the basis for  setting <a href="https://www.cpf.gov.sg/members/schemes/schemes/healthcare/medisave" target="_blank" title="MediSave">MediSave</a> Withdrawal Limits for IPs.</strong>
			
			<p>This will benefit the older policyholders as more of  their Medisave can be used to pay the higher premiums.</p></li>
			
			<li><strong>Allowing IP insurers to manage pre-existing conditions  differently</strong>
			
			<p>Instead of applying exclusion to pre-existing conditions,  insurers can consider other ways such as risk-loading (i.e. premium loading)  for policyholders who wish to pay more to have any pre-existing conditions  covered.</p></li>
			
			<li><strong>Reviewing regulation of IP and industry practices</strong>
			
			<p>This includes improving the way IPs are sold and  clearer communication between the insurers and the policyholders. </p></li>
			
			<li><strong>Suggestion to insurers to look into cost management  measures to manage medical inflation</strong>
			
			<p>The main reasons for increase in premiums are: the  generous &ldquo;as-charged&rdquo; feature and the high professional fees in the private  healthcare sectors. Insurers should consider establishing benchmarks for  professional fees to support cost management efforts and explore shared data to  allow better scrutiny of unusually large bills.</p></li>
		</ol>

        <h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/content/moh_web/medishield-life/integrated-shield-plans/about-integrated-shield-plans--ips-.html" target="_blank" title="Integrated Shield Plans">Integrated Shield Plan</a> is an important hospital insurance catering  to those who want coverage higher than B2/C wards. However, the way IPs are  currently operating has caused much concern and frustration. Now that the  government has stepped in to initiate improvements, the future of IPs will  hopefully become more relevant, more sustainable and more affordable.</p>
