<h3 class="primary-color"><strong>Chapter 4 - Which Type Of Insurance Is Suitable To Cover Our Needs?</strong></h3><br>
<p>There are 4 main types of insurance that pay out upon death, total and permanent disability (TPD) and dread disease (critical illness):</p><br>

<h3 class="primary-color">Endowment</h3><br>
<p>Endowment policies are designed to help us save for the future. We contribute a regular premium for a number of years and at the end of the policy duration we receive a lump sum maturity pay out. Some Endowment policies have a &quot;Cash Back&quot; feature, whereby yearly cash benefits are given at specified years in addition to the maturity pay out.</p>
<p>As endowment plans are mainly meant for savings, a much smaller portion of our premiums are used to pay insurance charges (mortality charge) that gives us the insurance coverage. Therefore, endowments are not suitable, if we are buying it for the purpose of protection. </p>
<p>We have no objections if we are using it for savings, either towards our <a href="https://www.diyinsurance.com.sg/portal/compare/retirement-income" target="_blank" title="Compare retirement income policies today!">retirement</a> fund or children&rsquo;s education fund. But we are not big advocates about endowments, simply because the returns may not be sufficient for us to achieve our goals, and also because of its inflexibility. In addition, we have given many other savings and investment options in <a href="../articles/html?title=The+Case+of+Term+vs+Whole+Life+Insurance%3A+Prologue+&+Chapter+1&art_id=37">Chapter 1</a>. So if we want to buy an endowment plan, do consider if they are enough for us to reach our goals. We might need to supplement it with other options.</p>
<p>To understand more about endowments, we might like to read the following educational articles:</p>

<h3 class="primary-color">Investment-Linked Policy (ILP)</h3><br>
<p><a href="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-financial-products/insurance/types-of-insurance/life-insurance/types-of-life-insurance/investment-linked-insurance-policies.aspx" target="_blank" title="Investment-Linked Policy">ILPs</a> are insurance policies that combine life insurance coverage with investments into unit trusts. Part of our premiums goes to pay for insurance charges that pay for the cost of insurance benefits, and part of it is used for investing. The investment value is liquid and it can be withdrawn from anytime.</p>
<p>For a regular premium ILP, the policyholder determines the annual premium amount, which stays level, as well as the percentage allocations to insurance charges and investments. However, ILPs are usually structured such that the insurance charges increase over time, which means that the remaining portion of the premiums that goes into investments shrinks over time. </p>
<p>We have written an article on why we do not advocate ILP at all. We can read more about <a href="../articles/html?title=Why+We+Don%27t+Advocate+ILPs+/+The+Problem+with+ILPs&art_id=13">it here.</a> </p>
<p>In gist, the main reason why we do not advocate buying an ILP is that we are limited by the choice of funds (unit trusts) that are being sold by that insurer. And if we are really keen to invest in unit trusts, there are plenty of choices outside the ILP space, why do we want to tie our hands unnecessarily?</p>
<p>As such, we do not advocate using ILPs for the purpose of protection.</p>
<br><br>
<h3 class="primary-color">Term Plan</h3><br>
<p>A <a href="https://www.diyinsurance.com.sg/portal/articles/html?title=Why+Most+Needs+can+be+Covered+by+Term+Insurance?&art_id=59" target=" _blank" title="Why Most Needs can be covered by Term Insurance">term plan</a> is one where by we only pay for pure protection. We do not give extra money to the insurance companies for them to invest it into their life fund. We also decide how long we want to cover ourselves for, using a term plan. As such, when a term plan runs its course, we no longer have any cover and also we do not get any money back. </p>
<p>Because of this, the premium for term plans is very low, for the same amount of coverage we would have paid for using a whole life plan or an <a hre ="http://www.moneysense.gov.sg/understanding-financial-products/insurance/types-of-insurance/life-insurance/types-of-life-insurance/investment-linked-insurance-policies.aspx" target="_blank" title="Investment-Linked Policy">ILP</a>. As such, term plan is the most affordable way for us to be fully covered for our needs.</p>

<small class="text-muted"><em>Table 4.2: Disadvantages of term plans</em></small>
<br><br><p>In our experience working with clients over the past almost 2 decades, many have told us that they bought whole life plans because they get some returns on the premiums they paid from whole life insurance whereas from term plans, they get nothing back at the end of say, 20 years. But this is a misunderstanding because the only reason why they get something back from whole life plan is because they gave the insurance company extra money above the insurance cost to invest. The insurance cost they paid for their protection portion of whole life plans has no return. It is an expense, just like term insurance.  </p>
<br><br>
<h3 class="primary-color">Whole Life Policy and Whole Life Hybrid Policy</h3><br>
<p>A whole life plan is one where we get permanent coverage - meaning that the insurance policy will continue for as long as we live. It used to be that we will also need to pay our premiums for as long as we live as well. However, nowadays, insurers are coming out mostly with limited pay whole life plans where we only pay for a limited period of your life, for example, till age 70 years old but the coverage is for as long as we live. So it seems like a steal, isn&rsquo;t it? Well, we all know there is no free lunch. What this means is that the insurance companies have already calculated the amount that we didn&rsquo;t have to pay from, say aged 70 and brought forward so that we pay more premium per year, till aged 65. <br>
 <br>
 The premium for whole life plan is high because for every dollar that we pay, a small proportion of it is taken to pay for insurance cost (mortality charge) and the rest is invested into the insurance companies' life fund. The life fund return is currently projected between 3.25% - 4.75% p.a. This is of course not guaranteed. What that means is that even if the life fund can return 4.75% p.a., we will only get 4.75% p.a return on the portion of the premium that is invested into the life fund. The portion of the premium that is paid for insurance cost is an expense. There is no return.</p>
<p>Increasingly, we see insurance companies launching what are known as &ldquo;Whole Life Hybrid&rdquo; products. These are packaged products that put a whole life plan and a term plan together. How a hybrid can be structured might be like this: A $50,000 whole life plan is packaged together with a $100,000 term plan that run till aged 70. So we get covered say $150K plus cash values for death, total and permanent disability, if it happens before say aged 70. If death, total and permanent disability happens after aged 70, we only get covered $50,000 plus cash value.</p>
<p>Hybrid plans are cheaper than pure whole life plans for the same coverage because of the embedded term component. But the premium is still much higher relative to a term plan.</p>

  <td><p>While this gives us some flexibility if we can no longer afford our premium, our sum  assured is reduced and we may not be sufficiently covered. Also, if we  surrender this policy subsequently, we won&rsquo;t have much cash value to take  back.</p></td>

<br><br>
<p>Many people buy whole life plans for dual purpose: coverage and saving for retirement. The problem with this approach is that because whole life&rsquo;s premium is too high for us to afford ourselves full cover, and the return is probably too low for us to reach our <a href="https://www.diyinsurance.com.sg/portal/compare/retirement-income" target="_blank" title="Compare retirement income policies today!">retirement</a> goal, we end up not achieving both objectives. We are stuck in the middle.</p>
<p>So whilst whole life plans are meant for protection purpose, the premium is expensive because:</p>
<ol>
	<li>There is an investment component</li>
	<li>The protection is for the entire life</li>
</ol>
<p>As we have said the primary purpose of insurance is for protection and not saving or investment, the question really is: Should we use term or whole life plan to meet our insurance needs? To answer this question, let&rsquo;s put all our discussion in the previous chapters together</p>

<h3 class="primary-color">Conclusion</h3>
<br>
<p>Based on our discussion so far, we can safely conclude that <strong>term plans are the most suitable plans for most people with higher priority needs. It is the most suitable because all of our higher priority needs are temporary needs. Secondly, as our need for coverage is quite high, it will simply be too expensive to use whole life plan to cover ourselves fully.</strong> </p>
<p>However, if we want the option of providing a lifetime of alternative medicine and care, then a whole life or a whole life hybrid insurance plan may be more appropriate. </p>
<p>Many a times, when we advocate the use of term plan for insurance planning purpose, people often question whether we are too broad stroke, too presumptuous to assume that all clients&rsquo; need are the same. Many have commented that we should not be one size fit all in our approach. The truth is, we agree that we should customise recommendations based on clients&rsquo; needs. </p>
<p>But the customisation is based on how much coverage one needs, based on the different factors which we have described above. After calculating the coverage amount needed, we can see that term plan is the most suitable, because all of our higher priority needs are temporary needs and the amount of coverage needed is usually too large to use a whole life plan to cover cost effectively. </p>
<p>Can someone insist on using whole life plan to cover that amount? The answer is obviously yes. But not many people can afford the premium and this person must have so much financial resources that after buying all the insurance he needs, he still has enough to plan for other areas of his life.</p>
<p><strong>Because of the above, we strongly advocate term plan as the insurance plan of choice, once the amount of coverage is established.</strong></p>
